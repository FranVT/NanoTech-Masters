## Shape memory polymer

The shape memory polymer posses the capability to fix temporary shape and recover its original shape upon subjected to external stimuli like,
    light
    water
    solvent
    pH
    temperature
    electricity.
Advanteges of SMP 
    - lows density 
    - high elastic deformation
    - good biocompatibility
    - good biodegradability 
    - fantastic tailor-ability.

Shape memory polymers consistes of permanent net-points and molecular switches of reversible nature.
The former memorizes the original shape while the latter are used for setting the temporary shape.

Permanent net-point can be formed by
    - molecule entenglement
    - crystalline phase 
    - chemical crosslinking
    - interpenetrated network

thermo-sensitive SMP containing physical (or chemical) network-points, which determine their original shape, while each temporary shape is fixed by switching domains associated to a thermal transition temperature (Ttrans)
    - crustallization/melting transition
    - vitrification/glass transition
    - reversible molecule cross-linking
    - supramolecular association/disassociation

Essential parameters:
    - Transition temperature
    - shape fixity ratio
    - shape recovery ratio

The viscoelastic and relaxation behaviors of SMP are attributed to the cooperative relaxation of each component.

The working mechanicsm in the thermos-responsive SMP is governed by the internal recovery stress and stored mechanical energy.

The polymers that are used for designing chape-memories are devided into thermoplastic and thermoset.

Thermoset SMPs can store more energy and endure more cycles than thermplastic ones due to the crosslinked bonds.
Themosplastic SMP can be manufactured by a facile processing method.

The introduction of nanofiller to SMP can unlock their potential for the integration of multiple stimulus methods, such as 
    - electro-activated, 
    - magnetic field actuated, 
    - light-responsive, 
    - near-infrared activated, 
    - water-induced, 
    - and thermal-responsive


Nanofillers can improve the mechanical performance and shape recovery stress of SMP through 
    - physical blending, 
    - in-situ polymerization 
    - and chemical cross-linking

the addition of carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene nanoplatelet is capable of converting the electrical current into heat through Joule effect and thus actuating the SMP

## Self healing polymer

Self-healing polymer (SHP) is one type of smart materials that can demonstrate healing-ability, in-situ damage repairing, and properties restoring.

There are two ways of healing strategies: 
    (i) intrinsic self-healing
    (ii) extrinsic self-healing.

The former is able to heal the damage (e.g. cracks) by the polymer itself, 
where the inherently thermally reversible  bonds of the material create a healing effect under external heating; 
while the latter is pre-embedded with healing agent (e.g., microcapsules, microvascular networks, hollow fibers).

self-healing materials on composite structures used in space environment. 
The self-healing materials were microcapsules containing 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene and dicyclopentadiene monomers with ruthenium Grubbs’ catalyst. 
The self-healing materials were then mixed with an epoxy resin (epoxy prepolymer Epon 828 and curing agent Epicure 3046) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT; loading: 2 wt%) by using vacuum centrifuging technique. 
The obtained SHP nanocomposites were infused into the layers of woven carbon fibers reinforced polymer (CFRP). 
The CFRP specimens were then subjected to hypervelocity impact conditions, which is prevailing in the space environment using a home-made implosion-driven hypervelocity launcher.


Intrinsic self-healing materials can undergo selfhealing processes multiple times through dynamic non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, π–π stacking) and dynamic covalent bonds (e.g., urea bonds, Diels‒Alder bonds). 
Self-healing materials based on dynamic covalent bonding have advantages such as high strength, increased thermal stability, and solvent resistance compared to self-healing materials based on non-covalent interactions
