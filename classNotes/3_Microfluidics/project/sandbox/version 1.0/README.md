# Version 1.0

This directory os for the new comsol files using the electrosmotic mixer tutorial as a main reference for the simulation methodology.

## Notes about the implementation.

We are trying to replicate the experiments shown in ... (later I'll include the reference).
The packing fraction needs to be converted into concentration witho units moles/m^3.

We need to find the following parameters:
- Conductivity of the fluid
- Zeta potential
- Difussion coefficient of the solution
- Density of the solution
- Dynamic viscosity
