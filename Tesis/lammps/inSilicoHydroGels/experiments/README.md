# experiments

Directory to store the simulations from different models:

## Model: TotalFree

All pairwise interactions can re-arrange.

## Model: CLFree

Just the interaction between patches of CL can re-arrange.
The rest of the interactions are simulated with a FENE potential.
When the bond length exceeds a certain distance, the bond is broken.

## Model: NoFree
All interactions are modeled with the FENE potential. When the bond length exceeds a certain distance, the bond is broken.
