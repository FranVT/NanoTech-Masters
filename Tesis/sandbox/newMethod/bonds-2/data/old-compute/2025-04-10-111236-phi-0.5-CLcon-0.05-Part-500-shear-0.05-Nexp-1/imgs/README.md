# About the figures

## Temp figure
I guess that the spikes during the shear are due to the small size of particles.

## pressure figure
Here are the computes for each subplot
- Pressure
    - compute pressure all td
- Norm Tensor pressure
    - compute pressure all td ke pair bond angle
- Full Virial pressure norm
    - compute pressure all td virial
- Modified Virial pressure norm
    - compute pressure all td pair bond angle

The main different between the first row and the second one, is that the first one considers kinetic energy and the second row does not.
The main difference between Full Virial and Modofied virial is that the Full Virial includes the contribution from the fix langevin and the modified does not.
