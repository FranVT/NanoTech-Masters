  abstract = {Development of 3D food printing applications requires in-depth knowledge on printing behaviour of food materials. In extrusion-based 3D printing, rheological properties of a recipe are critical to achieve successful printing. The objective of this research is to investigate potential correlations between printability of formulations and simple rheological properties. We used tomato paste as a model system to investigate the correlation between printing stability, dispensability and rheological properties. The results show a linear correlation between ingredient's flow stress, zero shear viscosity and corresponding printing stability. The extrusion pressure necessary to extrude tomato paste increased linearly with increasing flow stress. More experiments with other aqueous-based food formulations indicated that their printability aligned reasonably well with the correlation of tomato paste; however, for fat-based products different printing behaviour was observed. Finally, we propose a rational guideline for developing aqueous food recipes with desired printability based on flow stress measured by shear rheology.},

  abstract = {Die swelling is one of the paramount factors that impresses dimensional accuracy and quality of functional parts in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), one of the most famous Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. Die swelling is considered a critical phenomenon in polymer extrusion process affected by melt flow rate, extruder temperature and its geometry. In this research, the ABS melt polymer behavior in the extrusion process of FDM and the die swell of extruded polymer have been investigated by empirical experiments and simulated by the Finite Element Method (FEM) using rheological properties of ABS. The internal geometry of the nozzle is investigated via analytical simulation and finite element analysis to obtain pressure and velocity distributions of the material inside the extruder as well as the die swell of extruded filament. Additionally, experiments were carried out to validate the analytical and numerical simulations. The results showed that higher melt temperature and lower material flow rate result in less pressure drop inside the nozzle and less swelling of the extruded filament.},

The flow field is divided into a Newtonian part with high viscous Newtonian fluid and a bi-viscosity part with yielded/unyielded fluids.

The slip velocity at the disk is proportional to the pressure gradient, which is proportional to r in the Newtonian part and is approximately proportional to large r in the bi-viscosity part. Furthermore, the explicit expressions of the pressure and the squeeze force are acquired through the approximately linear relationship between the pressure gradient and r in the bi-viscosity part. Also, distributions of the radial velocity and shear stress, and the effects of the slip coefficient, plastic viscosity and viscosity ratio on the radial velocity, pressure gradient, squeeze force and yield surface are discussed.},

The resulting flow curve is non-monotonic with one or even two narrow unstable branches corresponding to the stick–slip instability regime. The sizes of these two unstable regimes are reduced as the radii ratio is reduced. It is demonstrated that the second unstable branch may not be observed at all due to the presence of stable steady-states.

There are two phenomenological descriptions of slip: The first is based on the presence of a very thin, low viscosity boundary layer and has been derived for capillary flow and extrusion; the second is based on a Coulomb‐friction mechanism and has been derived for capillary flow only. After a survey of these results, the friction model is derived for the extrusion process. All calculations are as simple as possible: two‐dimensional, Newtonian, isothermal, and with constant boundary layer parameters of coefficients of friction. A strong dependence of pumping characteristics and efficiency on the slip boundary conditions, and also on the extruder length in the case of friction, was found, especially when slip is only allowed for at the screw surface. Exercises like these may help in understanding abnormal extrusion behavior of slippery materials in practice.},

In the intermediate regime for the annular problem, slip occurs only at the inner-wall, while for the rectangular problem, there are two intermediate regimes for which there are no analytical solutions.

In addition, we propose a new regularized slip equation which is valid uniformly at any wall shear stress level by means of another regularization parameter. Four different flow regimes are observed defined by three critical values of the pressure gradient. Initially no slip occurs, in the second regime slip occurs only in the middle of the wider wall, in the third regime slip occurs partially at both walls, and eventually variable slip occurs everywhere. The performance of the regularized slip equation in the two intermediate regimes in which wall slip is partial has been tested for both Newtonian and Bingham flows. The convergence of the results with the Papanastasiou regularization parameter has been also studied. The combined effects of viscoplasticity and slip are then investigated. Results are presented for wide ranges of the Bingham and slip numbers and for various values of the power-law exponent and the duct aspect ratio. These compare favorably with available theoretical results and with numerical results in the literature obtained with both regularization and augmented Lagrangian methods.},

The Papanastasiou regularization of the constitutive equation is employed. As for the slip equation, a power-law expression is used to relate the wall shear stress to the slip velocity, assuming that slip occurs only above a critical wall shear stress, known as the slip yield stress. It is shown that, when the latter is zero, the fluid slips at all times, the velocity becomes and remains uniform before complete cessation, and the stopping time is finite only when the slip exponent s{$<$}1. In the case of Navier slip (s=1), the stopping time is infinite for any non-zero Bingham number and the volumetric flow rate decays exponentially. When s{$>$}1, the decay is much slower. Analytical expressions of the decay of the flat velocity for any value of s and of the stopping time for s{$<$}1 are also derived. Using a discontinuous slip equation with slip yield stress poses numerical difficulties even in one dimensional time-dependent flows, since the transition times from slip to no-slip and vice versa are not known a priori. This difficulty is overcome by regularizing the slip equation. The numerical results showed that when the slip yield stress is non-zero, slip ceases at a finite critical time, the velocity becomes flat only in complete cessation, and the stopping times are finite, in agreement with theoretical estimates.},

  abstract = {Hydrogels are widely used in the development of bioinks for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting (EBB). The rheological properties of these materials have already been studied extensively in the literature, and characteristics such as shear-thinning, yield stress and quick structural recovery upon flow cessation are deemed key properties to obtain bioinks of superior performance in EBB. However, there are still inconsistencies in the usage of shear rheology for the characterization of hydrogels for EBB. Therefore, this review discusses the rheometrical techniques applied to the development and characterization of inks for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting. More specifically, the focus will be on the applicability of shear rheometry in EBB as well as important underlying rheological concepts. Rheological tests were categorized according to the nature of the applied stimuli during rheometrical testing, e.g., continuous or oscillatory shear rheometry. In the first class of tests, the flow curves and the shear-thinning behaviour of Power-law fluids are tackled, and the relevance of this effect is discussed in the context of EBB and cell viability. The importance of rapid structural recovery of the material after shear-thinning is illustrated with examples. Then, the Herschel-Bulkley model for yield stress fluids and their connection with improved shape fidelity is highlighted. Oscillatory tests, such as amplitude-, frequency-, temperature- and time-sweeps, and their most relevant applications in EBB, such as gel strength and flowability, gel/liquid-like states, transition temperatures and processing temperatures, and equilibrium modulus after crosslinking are closely reviewed.

  abstract = {The present study is concerned with the Marsh cone, a workability test used for specification and quality control of cement pastes and grouts. It is demonstrated here that, under several consistency and geometry conditions, the flow time reflecting “fluidity” may be calculated from the plastic viscosity and yield stress in the case of a Bingham fluid and from the cone geometry. A relation between the behaviour parameters and the flow time of fresh pastes tested is derived and experimentally validated. A practical application of these results is suggested. Lastly, the concept of a new test apparatus based on two cones is presented and tested on a single cement paste.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the numerical computation of the two-dimensional flow of yield stress fluids (with Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley models) based on a variational approach and a finite element discretization. The main goal of this paper is to propose an alternative optimization method to existing procedures such as penalization and augmented Lagrangian techniques. It is shown that the minimum principle for Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley yield stress fluid steady flows can, indeed, be formulated as a secondorder cone programming (SOCP) problem, for which very efficient primal–dual interior point solvers are available. In particular, the formulation does not require any regularization of the visco-plastic model as is usually the case for existing techniques, avoiding therefore the difficult choice of the regularization parameter. Besides, it is also unnecessary to adopt a mixed stress–velocity approach or discretize explicitly auxiliary variables as frequently proposed in existing methods. Finally, the performance of dedicated SOCP solvers, like the MOSEK software package, enables us to solve large-scale problems on a personal computer within seconds only. The proposed method will be validated on classical benchmark examples and used to simulate the flow generated around a plate during its withdrawal from a bath of yield stress fluid.},

Finite element method was therefore used to first analyze flow field distribution of selected gels (pumpkin, potato and purple sweet potato gels) undergoing 3D printing and then predict the extrusion force of such gels. Experimental extrusion force was correlated with simulated extrusion force; adequate agreement was noted (R2~=~0.98). Pressure suitable for 3D printing of the gels was determined, being lower than 200~kPa for the tested gels. The extrusion curves indicate that there exists a buffer time after which each gel would start to flow. An increase in the gel water content and a decrease in the nozzle diameter increase the extrusion force and the buffer time. The results of this study may serve as a benchmark for printing materials development and printing parameters selection for successful extrusion-based 3D printing.},

Despite a large amount of experimental activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles in silico. We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent (cross-linkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead−spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our assembly protocol, we focus on a small microgel test case and show that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated assembly methodologies, e.g., in the case of networks generated from an underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely used fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modeling of microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.},

After assembly, the network connectivity and topology are frozen and the resulting system is characterized. We find that the fractal structure of the network depends on the number density at which the assembly has been carried out, but that systems with the same mean valence and same assembly density have the same structural properties. Moreover, we compute the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement, also known as the (squared) localization length, of the cross-links and of the middle monomers of the strands, showing that the dynamics of long strands is well described by the tube model. Finally, we find a relation connecting these two localization lengths at high density and connect the cross-link localization length to the shear modulus of the system.},

In order to elucidate how these properties are controlled by the physical details of the network (e.g., chain-length and end-to-end distributions), we generate disordered phantom networks with different cross-linker concentrations C and initial densities ρinit and evaluate their elastic properties. We find that the shear modulus computed at the same strand concentration for networks with the same C, which determines the number of chains and the chain-length distribution, depends strongly on the preparation protocol of the network, here controlled by ρinit. We rationalize this dependence by employing a generic stress−strain relation for polymer networks that does not rely on the specific form of the polymer end-to-end distance distribution. We find that the shear modulus of the networks is a nonmonotonic function of the density of elastically active strands, and that this behavior has a purely entropic origin. Our results show that if short chains are abundant, as it is always the case for randomly cross-linked polymer networks, the knowledge of the exact chain conformation distribution is essential for correctly predicting the elastic properties. Finally, we apply our theoretical approach to literature experimental data, qualitatively confirming our interpretations.},

  abstract = {The pervasive presence of plastic waste in the aquatic environment is widely viewed as one of the most serious environmental challenges for current and future generations. Microplastics ultimately degrade into nano and smaller-sizes. In turn, their biological and ecological impacts become more complicated and ambiguous. Nano-plastic particles travel from freshwater systems to estuarine and oceanic regions, during which they can interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM) to form microgels. Microgel formation is ubiquitous in aquatic systems, serving as a shunt between DOM and particulate organic matter (POM), as well as playing key roles in particle aggregation/sedimentation and pollutant transport. Currently the influences and mechanisms of the aggregation behavior and environmental fate of nano-plastics in different aquatic environments is poorly understood. Here, we report that 25~nm polystyrene nano-particles in lake and river water can promote POM (microgel) formation and accelerate the DOM–POM transition. We also adjusted various salinities of water samples to simulate scenarios based on plastic transport in waters flowing from rivers to seas. The results indicate polystyrene nanoparticles can interact with organic matter to form large organic particles, which may undergo further settling in response to specific salinity levels. Polystyrene-induced microgel formation appears to involve the hydrophobic interactions between plastics and DOM. Our data provides much needed information for modeling and understanding the retention and sedimentation of nano-plastics. We show that nano-plastics alter the DOM–POM shunt to cause unanticipated perturbations in the functionality of aquatic ecosystems.},

The poly(NIPAm-co-NAS) (PNN-X) microgels, with varying compositions of NIPAm and NAS monomers, were synthesized via a surfactant-assisted precipitation copolymerization. Subsequently, membranes were constructed by vacuum filtration of a dilute microgel suspension over a track-etched support followed by cross-linking with TRIPS. After thorough structural, morphological, and physicochemical characterizations, filtration and rejection properties were assessed. The nanostructured microgel membranes exhibited excellent water permeation with smart gating properties, owing to the high-water absorptivity and thermoresponsiveness of the microgel. The nanosized pores, formed due to the densely packed microgels and its own cross-linked structure, enabled strong rejection of low molecular weight dyes and macromolecules. Furthermore, the pore size tunability under external stimuli provided the capability for stepwise separation of different solutes with varying diameters by controlling their molecular transmission through the membrane. In summary, the prepared nanoporous zwitterionic microgel membrane exhibits strong antifouling properties with smart permeation and molecular separation, signifying its potential for water purification and various environmental separation and filtration.}

However, there is still little knowledge on the sedimentation of deformable beads. In this work, we employ fully three-dimensional finite-element numerical simulations to investigate the sedimentation of an initially spherical elastic bead in a Newtonian liquid contained inside a square-cross section vessel. In particular, we carry out a wide parametric analysis to understand the effects of inertia, particle deformability, and geometrical confinement on the particle sedimentation dynamics and settling velocity. In addition, the sedimentation of a particle in a Newtonian liquid close to a vertical wall is studied. When the particle sediments at the center of the vessel, the settling velocity increases at increasing inertia and decreases at increasing confinement and deformability. However, at intermediate inertia, the settling velocity passes through a minimum and then rises as the particle gets softer. Correspondingly, the equilibrium deformed shape of the particle shows the appearance of a concavity at the rear. When the sedimentation occurs close to a vertical wall, the closer the particle to the solid surface, the slower its sedimentation. On the other hand, the hydrodynamic interaction between the particle and the wall makes the particle move away from the wall.},

  abstract = {Developing a cost-effective, stable, and recyclable adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and rapid adsorption kinetics is highly demanded for water treatment but has been proven challenging. Herein, we report a one-step strategy to synthesize tough porous nanocomposite hydrogel, by introducing biochar nanoparticles and interconnected pores into a polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix as an exemplary system. The polyacrylamide hydrogel provides the overall mechanical strength to carry loads and facilitate recycling, the biochar provides adsorptive locus for high adsorption capacity, and the interconnected pores expedite solvent transport for rapid adsorption kinetics. Mechanical characterizations manifest that the porous biochar hydrogel possesses a tensile strength of 128~kPa, a stretchability of 5.9, and a toughness of 538~J~m–2. Porous structure analysis reveals that the hydrogel contains an increscent specific surface area by 441\% and an augmented pore volume by 279\% compared to pure polyacrylamide hydrogel. Experiments pertaining to adsorption isotherms and kinetics, with methylene blue as the model adsorbate, indicate enhanced adsorption performances. The tough hydrogel also allows facile recycling and maintains mechanical robustness after five regeneration cycles. Furthermore, biocompatibility is endorsed by cytotoxicity test. The proposed method could open an ample space for designing and synthesizing tough porous nanocomposite hydrogels for water treatment.},

  abstract = {With the development of science and technology, photocatalytic technology is of great interest. Nanosized photocatalysts are easy to agglomerate in an aqueous solution, which is unfavorable for recycling. Therefore, hydrogel-based photocatalytic composites were born. Compared with other photocatalytic carriers, hydrogels have a three-dimensional network structure, high water absorption, and a controllable shape. Meanwhile, the high permeability of these composites is an effective way to promote photocatalysis technology by inhibiting nanoparticle photo corrosion, while significantly ensuring the catalytic activity of the photocatalysts. With the growing energy crisis and limited reserves of traditional energy sources such as oil, the attention of researchers was drawn to natural polymers. Like almost all abundant natural polymer compounds in the world, cellulose has the advantages of non-toxicity, degradability, and biocompatibility. It is used as a class of reproducible crude material for the preparation of hydrogel photocatalytic composites. The network structure and high hydroxyl active sites of cellulose-based hydrogels improve the adsorption performance of catalysts and avoid nanoparticle collisions, indirectly enhancing their photocatalytic performance. In this paper, we sum up the current research progress of cellulose-based hydrogels. After briefly discussing the properties and preparation methods of cellulose and its descendant hydrogels, we explore the effects of hydrogels on photocatalytic properties. Next, the cellulose-based hydrogel photocatalytic composites are classified according to the type of catalyst, and the research progress in different fields is reviewed. Finally, the challenges they will face are summarized, and the development trends are prospected.},

Introducing a rigid conductive material into the hydrogels can improve their electrical conductivities. However, it may have poor interfacial compatibility with the flexible hydrogel matrix. Therefore, we prepared a hydrogel containing flexible and highly ductile liquid metal (LM). The hydrogel can be used as a strain sensor to monitor human motion. The hydrogel showed many properties (i.e., recyclability, EMI shielding properties (33.14~dB), antibacterial (100~\%), strain sensitivity (gauge factor~=~2.92), and self-healing) that cannot be achieved simultaneously by a single hydrogel. Furthermore, the recycling of LM and their application to hydrogel-based EMI shielding materials have not been investigated previously. Due to its excellent properties, the prepared flexible hydrogel has great potential for applications in artificial intelligence, personal healthcare, and wearable devices.},

Due to their high functionality, swelling characteristics, bio-compatibility, non-toxic nature and high adsorption capacity, hydrogels are strong contenders for a practical solution aimed at heavy metal adsorption. Studies aiming at the regeneration potential of hydrogel have reported only 10–15\% loss of adsorption capacity for three to five cycles of reuse. For the past decade, hydrogels have been the focus of research as a green absorbent. Cellulose, being the most abundant natural polymer, is an obvious choice for hydrogel base. Additionally, the hydroxyl groups on cellulose provide feasibility for synthesis of multiple structures of hydrogels. This review discusses the chemistry of cellulose, various plant-based sources for cellulose hydrogel, structure of hydrogel, synthesis routes followed by adsorption mechanism, theoretical study of cellulose-metal adsorption using density functional theory, kinetics and isotherms specific to heavy metal adsorption on cellulose hydrogel.},

  abstract = {Water is a vital resource that is required for social and economic development. A rapid increase in industrialization and numerous anthropogenic activities have resulted in severe water contamination. In particular, the contamination caused by heavy metal discharge has a negative impact on human health and the aquatic environment due to the non-biodegradability, toxicity, and carcinogenic effects of heavy metals. Thus, there is an immediate need to recycle wastewater before releasing heavy metals into water bodies. Hydrogels, as potent adsorbent materials, are a good contenders for treating toxic heavy metals in wastewater. Hydrogels are a soft matter formed via the cross-linking of natural or synthetic polymers to develop a three-dimensional mesh structure. The inherent properties of hydrogels, such as biodegradability, swell-ability, and functionalization, have made them superior applications for heavy metal removal. In this review, we have emphasized the recent development in the synthesis of hydrogel-based adsorbent materials. The review starts with a discussion on the methods used for recycling wastewater. The discussion then shifts to properties, classification based on various criteria, and surface functionality. In addition, the synthesis and adsorption mechanisms are explained in detail with the understanding of the regeneration, recovery, and reuse of hydrogel-based adsorbent materials. Therefore, the cost-effective, facile, easy to modify and biodegradable hydrogel may provide a long-term solution for heavy metal removal.},

  abstract = {Physical systems are frequently modeled as sets of points in space, each representing the position of an atom, molecule, or mesoscale particle. As many properties of such systems depend on the underlying ordering of their constituent particles, understanding that structure is a primary objective of condensed matter research. Although perfect crystals are fully described by a set of translation and basis vectors, real-world materials are never perfect, as thermal vibrations and defects introduce significant deviation from ideal order. Meanwhile, liquids and glasses present yet more complexity. A complete understanding of structure thus remains a central, open problem. Here we propose a unified mathematical framework, based on the topology of the Voronoi cell of a particle, for classifying local structure in ordered and disordered systems that is powerful and practical. We explain the underlying reason why this topological description of local structure is better suited for structural analysis than continuous descriptions. We demonstrate the connection of this approach to the behavior of physical systems and explore how crystalline structure is compromised at elevated temperatures. We also illustrate potential applications to identifying defects in plastically deformed polycrystals at high temperatures, automating analysis of complex structures, and characterizing general disordered systems.},

  abstract = {A fluid particle changes its dynamics from diffusive to oscillatory as the system density increases up to the melting density. Hence the notion of the Frenkel line was introduced to demarcate the fluid region into rigid and nonrigid liquid subregions based on the collective particle dynamics. In this work, we apply a topological framework to locate the Frenkel lines of the soft-sphere and the hard-sphere models relying on the system configurations. The topological characteristics of the ideal gas and the maximally random jammed state are first analyzed, then the classification scheme designed in our earlier work is applied to soft-sphere and hard-sphere fluids. The dependence of the classification result on the bulk density is understood based on the theory of fluid polyamorphism. The percolation behavior of solid-like clusters is described based on the fraction of solid-like molecules in an integrated manner. The crossover densities are obtained by examining the percolation of solid-like clusters. The resultant crossover densities of soft-sphere fluids converge to that of hard-sphere fluid. Hence the topological method successfully highlights the generality of the Frenkel line.},

The model systems used for demonstrating the correlations are characterized by two different and prototypical types of short-range order (SRO): a Cu64Zr36 MG exhibiting pronounced icosahedral SRO, and a Pd82Si18 MG representative of a metal–metalloid system, with solute-centered tri-capped trigonal prisms as the dominant local motif. Also outlined are some ideas in terms of the relationship between the glass structures and properties, including the challenges in correlating the local structures with the propensity for relaxation and shear transformations.},

  abstract = {A popular Adam-Gibbs scenario has suggested that the excess entropy of glass and liquid over crystal dominates the dynamical arrest at the glass transition with exclusive contribution from configurational entropy over vibrational entropy. However, an intuitive structural rationale for the emergence of frozen dynamics in relation to entropy is still lacking. Here we study these issues by atomistically simulating the vibrational, configurational, as well as total entropy of a model glass former over their crystalline counterparts for the entire temperature range spanning from glass to liquid. Besides confirming the Adam-Gibbs entropy scenario, the concept of Shannon information entropy is introduced to characterize the diversity of atomic-level structures, which undergoes a striking variation across the glass transition, and explains the change found in the excess configurational entropy. Hence, the hidden structural mechanism underlying the entropic kink at the transition is revealed in terms of proliferation of certain atomic structures with a higher degree of centrosymmetry, which are more rigid and possess less nonaffine softening modes. In turn, the proliferation of these centrosymmetric (rigid) structures leads to the freezing-in of the dynamics beyond which further structural rearrangements become highly unfavorable, thus explaining the kink in the configurational entropy at the transition.},

From these data we extract a network model that replicates the pore space. By compacting the packing or swelling individual spheres, we may generate model porous media of different porosities whose microstructure is also completely determined. We simulate both viscous- and capillary-dominated invasion of a nonwetting fluid into a wetting fluid contained in these media. During invasion we calculate the average hydraulic conductance of each phase to obtain the relative permeabilities as a function of fluid saturation. Because the microstructure is known, the calculations do not involve any adjustable parameters or supplementary measurements of pore structure. The computed relative permeabilities are successfully compared with experimental values previously measured on sand packs, bead packs, and a simple sandstone.},

The packing structure is analyzed, facilitated by the well established Voronoi tessellation. The topological and metric properties of Voronoi polyhedra are quantified as a function of particle size and packing density. The results show that as particle size or packing density decreases, (i) the average face number of Voronoi polyhedra decreases, and the distributions of face number and edge number become broader and more asymmetric; (ii) the average perimeter and area of polyhedra increase, and the distributions of polyhedron surface area and volume become more flat and can be described by the log-normal distribution. The topological and metric properties depicted for the packing of fine particles differ either quantitatively or qualitatively from those reported in the literature although they all can be related to packing density. In particular, our results show that the average sphericity coefficient of Voronoi polyhedra varies with packing density, and although Aboav-Weaire’s law is generally applicable, Lewis’s law is not valid when packing density is low, which are contrary to the previous findings for other packing systems.},

  abstract = {Many physical systems can be studied as collections of particles embedded in space, often evolving in time. Natural questions arise concerning how to characterize these arrangements—are they ordered or disordered? If they are ordered, how are they ordered and what kinds of defects do they possess? Voronoi tessellations, originally introduced to study problems in pure mathematics, have become a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing countless problems in pure and applied physics. We explain the basics of Voronoi tessellations and the shapes that they produce and describe how they can be used to characterize many physical systems.},

Implications of this potential are then explored by molecular-dynamics computer simulation, using 216 atoms with periodic boundary conditions. Starting with the diamond-structure crystal at low temperature, heating causes spontaneous nucleation and melting. The resulting liquid structurally resembles the real Si melt. By carrying out steepest-descent mappings of system configurations onto potential-energy minima, two main conclusions emerge: (1) a temperature-independent inherent structure underlies the liquid phase, just as for ‘‘simple’’ liquids with only pair interactions; (2) the Lindemann melting criterion for the crystal apparently can be supplemented by a freezing criterion for the liquid, where both involve critical values of appropriately defined mean displacements from potential minima.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly is ubiquitous in nature and underlies the formation of many complex systems from the molecular to the macroscopic scale. Kern–Frenkel-like patchy particles are powerful models to investigate this phenomenon by computational methods such as Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations. However, in these models the interactions are mediated by circular patches at the particle surface, which can be hardly mapped to realistic systems, containing for instance faceted particles with rectangular surfaces. In this paper we extend the model to take into account such geometries, and we use it to build a supra coarse-grained model of the cellulose nanocrystal where the interactions are parametrized against all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The formation of cholesteric ribbons and defects in cholesteric droplets of the cellulose nanocrystal are investigated and confirm experimental behavior reported in the literature. The flexibility of this new patchy particle model makes it a powerful tool to develop supra coarse-grained models of self-assembly for large space and time scales and should find a broad range of applications for self-assembly in chemical and biological systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, 2D simulation of a pH-sensitive hydrogel is performed by a novel strong-form meshless method called the random differential quadrature (RDQ) method. So far the simulations of pH-responsive hydrogels have been performed over 1D hydrogel domains by simplification, where the hydrogel is allowed to deform in one direction only with a constant axis-symmetric cross-section. However, for an irregular cross-section, in which the hydrogel swells unevenly in different directions, it truly becomes the 2D problem. The RDQ method is a novel meshless technique based on the fixed reproducing kernel particle method and the differential quadrature method. The diffusion of mobile ionic species between the hydrogel and solution is simulated by the system of the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations, and the hydrogel swelling is captured by mechanical equilibrium equations. The analytical expressions of displacements in the x and y directions are derived for a constant osmotic pressure at field nodes located along the interface between the hydrogel and solution domains. The numerical values of the displacements are verified with the corresponding analytical values obtained from the derived expressions for a hydrogel with square geometry. It is shown from the simulation results that the RDQ method is capable of capturing the jumps in the values of field variables across the interface between the multiple domains. The hydrogel swelling is studied by changing Young's modulus and the geometrical shape, and the simulation results are found qualitatively in good agreement with the physics of the problem.},

Laponite in the clay served as a cross-linking agent in the first network. The necking phenomenon and strain hardening ware observed in the double network nanocomposite hydrogel, and the mechanical properties of the double network nanocomposite hydrogel changed according to the monomer ratio of the first network. With a low concentration of soft DMAAm units, the first network shows necking, but no strain hardening and low tensile strength. However, a high concentration of DMAAm results in no necking and strain hardening. The mechanical properties of the double network nanocomposite hydrogel are dependent on the degree of multi-crosslinking of DMAAm with the clay in the first network structure. The degree of swelling of the double network nanocomposite hydrogel was independent of the monomer composition ratio of first network structure.},

  abstract = {Most tough hydrogels are reinforced by introducing energy dissipation mechanisms, but simultaneously realizing a high toughness and low hysteresis is challenging because the energy dissipation structure cannot recover rapidly. In this work, high mechanical performance highly entangled double network hydrogels without energy dissipation structure are fabricated, in which physical entanglements act as the primary effective crosslinking in the first network. This sliding entanglement structure allows the hydrogel network to form a highly uniform oriented structure during stretching, resulting in a high tensile strength of \textasciitilde 3\,MPa, a fracture energy of 8340\,J\,m−2 and a strain-stiffening capability of 47.5 in 90\% water content. Moreover, almost 100\% reversibility is obtained in this hydrogel via energy storage based on entropy loss. The highly entangled double network structure not only overcomes the typical trade-off between the high toughness and low hysteresis of hydrogels, but more importantly, it provides an insight into the application of entanglement structures in high-performance hydrogels.},

In this study, a tough composite gel could be prepared by synthesizing polymer particles within a polymer network having relatively loose cross-linking. Since the polymer network acts as a dispersion stabilizer during the synthesis of the hydrophobic polymer particles, a large amount of particles could be introduced into the gel without agglomeration. It was suggested that the high level of toughness was induced by the adsorption and desorption of the polymer chains on the surface of the finely packed particles. By using a stimuli-responsive polymer network, elasticity and plasticity of composite gels could be controlled in response to external stimuli, and adhesion on the gel surface could also be modulated.},

  abstract = {Electroactive hydrogels that exhibit large deformation in response to an electric field have received significant attention as a potential actuating material for soft actuators and artificial muscle. However, their mechanical actuation has been limited in simple bending or folding due to uniform electric field modulation. To implement complex movements, a pre-program, such as a hinge and a multilayer pattern, is usually required for the actuator in advance. Here, we propose a reprogrammable actuating method and sophisticated manipulation by using multipolar three-dimensional electric field modulation without pre-program. Through the multipolar spatial electric field modulator, which controls the polarity/intensity of the electric field in three-dimensions, complex three-dimensional (3D) actuation of single hydrogels are achieved. Also, air bubbles generated during operation in the conventional horizontal configuration are not an issue in the proposed new vertical configuration. We demonstrate soft robotic actuators, including basic bending mechanics in terms of controllability and reliability, and several 3D shapes having positive and negative curvature can easily be achieved in a single sheet, paving the way for continuously reconfigurable materials.},

A toughness improvement of over 175 times is achieved by the implantation of such hard-soft alternatively layered microstructure. The toughening mechanism is the stretching of hydrogels at the nano-scale and deflections of micro-cracks at the interfaces, which avoid stress concentration and dissipate huge energy. Furthermore, this cement-hydrogel composite also exhibits a low thermal conductivity (around 1/10 of normal cement) and density, high specific strength and self-healing properties, which can be used in thermal insulation, seismic high-rise buildings and long-span bridges.},

Under compressive loading, relief structures in the hydrogel intensify net ion fluxes induced by deformation gradient, which synergize with asymmetric ion adsorption characteristics of the electrodes and distinct diffusivity of cations and anions in the hydrogel matrix. This engineered mechanoionic process can yield 4\,mA (5.5\,A\,m−2) of peak current under cyclic compression of 80 kPa applied at 0.1\,Hz, with the transferred charge reaching up to 916 mC m−2 per cycle. The high current output of this miniaturized hydrogel generator is beneficial for the powering of wearable devices, as exemplified by a controlled drug-releasing system for wound healing. The demonstrated mechanisms for amplifying mechanoionic effect will enable further designs for a variety of self-powered biomedical systems.},

This hydrogel features an internal structure that facilitates the motion of a chain walker within its network, effectively dissipating mechanical stress. The hydrogel network architecture allows for rapid restoration of its damping capacity, often within seconds, ensuring swift material recovery post-deformation. We further demonstrate that this hydrogel can significantly shield encapsulated cells from mechanical trauma under repetitive compression, owing to its proficient energy damping and rapid rebound characteristics. Therefore, this hydrogel has potential for dynamic load applications like artificial muscles and synthetic cartilage, expanding the use of hydrogel dampers in biomechanics and related areas.},

In this communication, phase-field approach was used to simulate this process and to obtain the tuning parameters of the model including thickness of the contact surface (є), phase transform parameter (M0), and excess free energy (∧). Diffusion of hydrogels was studied by Cahn–Hilliard conservative approach and the breakage, deformation, and plugging mechanisms were analyzed, based on pressure drop variations in micromodel. Moreover, Effective parameters on oil recovery factor were analyzed. Results indicated a good agreement between experimental and modeling studies of oil recovery factor in water and hydrogel flooding with absolute errors of 2.29\% and 4.06\%, respectively.

The apparent difference in cavitation threshold pressure between that generates in pure water and that in gelatin hydrogel is considered. Gelatin, which is derived from collagen, is frequently used as a brain simulant material. In liquid, cavitation bubble is created when surrounding pressure drops below the saturation vapor pressure. In principle, a cavitation bubble should continue to grow as long as tensile pressure continues to increase in the system. In our study, using molecular dynamics simulation, we have investigated the pressure requirement for a nanoscale cavitation to grow in water and gel. First, we have modeled a gel like structure with a preexisting bubble of 5\,nm radius. A control model containing a 5\,nm bubble in pure water is also created. Then, we have applied hydrostatic tensile pressure at two different expansion rates in the gel and water models. The results show that a gel-like structure requires higher pressure for the cavitation to grow, and both gel and water models exhibit strain rate effect on the cavitation threshold pressure. We have also found that the cavitation collapse time is dominated by the viscosity of the medium.},

  abstract = {Natural and synthetic hydrogel scaffolds exhibit distinct viscoelastic properties at various length scales and deformation rates. Laser Speckle Rheology (LSR) offers a novel, non-contact optical approach for evaluating the frequency-dependent viscoelastic properties of hydrogels. In LSR, a coherent laser beam illuminates the specimen and a high-speed camera acquires the time-varying speckle images. Cross-correlation analysis of frames returns the speckle intensity autocorrelation function, g2(t), from which the frequency-dependent viscoelastic modulus, G*(ω), is deduced. Here, we establish the capability of LSR for evaluating the viscoelastic properties of hydrogels over a large range of moduli, using conventional mechanical rheometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based indentation as reference-standards. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between |G*(ω)| values measured by LSR and mechanical rheometry (r\,=\,0.95, p\,{$<$}\,10−9), and z-test analysis reports that moduli values measured by the two methods are identical (p\,{$>$}\,0.08) over a large range (47\,Pa – 36\,kPa). In addition, |G*(ω)| values measured by LSR correlate well with indentation moduli, E, reported by AFM (r\,=\,0.92, p\,{$<$}\,10−7). Further, spatially-resolved moduli measurements in micro-patterned substrates demonstrate that LSR combines the strengths of conventional rheology and micro-indentation in assessing hydrogel viscoelastic properties at multiple frequencies and small length-scales.},

  abstract = {The Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential (LJ) is arguably the most widely used pair potential in molecular simulations. In fact, it is so popular that the question is rarely asked whether it is fit for purpose. In this paper, we argue that, whilst the LJ potential was designed for noble gases such as argon, it is often used for systems where it is not expected to be particularly realistic. Under those circumstances, the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant: most important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always modified such that it has a finite range. More seriously, there is by now a whole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6, and that are all different – and that may have very different macroscopic properties. In this paper, we consider alternatives to the LJ 12-6 potential that could be employed under conditions where the LJ potential is only used as a typical short-ranged potential with attraction. We construct a class of potentials that are, in many respects LJ-like but that are by construction finite ranged, vanishing quadratically at the cut-off distance, and that are designed to be computationally cheap. Below, we present this potential and report numerical data for its thermodynamic and transport properties, for the most important cases (cut-off distance rc = 2σ (“LJ-like”) and rc = 1.2σ (a typical “colloidal” potential)).},

However, these applications require the fabrication of hydrogels with complex, heterogeneous and reconfigurable structures and customizable functions. Here we report the fabrication of hydrogel assemblies with these features by reversibly gluing hydrogel units using a photocontrolled metallopolymer adhesive. The metallopolymer adhesive firmly attached individual hydrogel units via metal–ligand coordination and polymer chain entanglement. Hydrogel assemblies containing temperature- and pH-responsive hydrogel units showed controllable shape changes and motions in response to these external stimuli. To reconfigure their structures, the hydrogel assemblies were disassembled by irradiating the metallopolymer adhesive with light; the disassembled hydrogel units were then reassembled using the metallopolymer adhesive with heating. The shape change and structure reconfiguration abilities allow us to reprogramme the functions of hydrogel assemblies. The development of reconfigurable hydrogel assemblies using reversible adhesives provides a strategy for designing intelligent materials and soft robots with user-defined functions.},

Since the entanglement length Ne is found to be approximately 35, our chains cover the crossover from the nonentangled to the entangled regime. The Rouse model provides an excellent description for short chains N\&lt;Ne, while the dynamics of the long chains can be described by the reptation model. By mapping the model chains onto chemical species we give estimates of the times and distances of onset of the slowing down in motion due to reptation. Comparison to neutron spin‐echo data confirm our mapping procedure, resolving a discrepancy between various experiments. By considering the primitive chain we are able to directly visualize the confinement to a tube. Analyzing the Rouse mode relaxation allows us to exclude the generalized Rouse models, while the original reptation prediction gives a good description of the data.},

  abstract = {Contact lenses are one of the most successful applications of biomaterials. The chemical structure of the polymers used in contact lenses plays an important role in determining the function of contact lenses. Different types of contact lenses have been developed based on the chemical structure of polymers. When designing contact lenses, materials scientists consider factors such as mechanical properties, processing properties, optical properties, histocompatibility, and antifouling properties, to ensure long-term wear with minimal discomfort. Advances in contact lens materials have addressed traditional issues such as oxygen permeability and biocompatibility, improving overall comfort, and duration of use. For example, silicone hydrogel contact lenses with high oxygen permeability were developed to extend the duration of use. In addition, controlling the surface properties of contact lenses in direct contact with the cornea tissue through surface polymer modification mimics the surface morphology of corneal tissue while maintaining the essential properties of the contact lens, a significant improvement for long-term use and reuse of contact lenses. This review presents the material science elements required for advanced contact lenses of the future and summarizes the chemical methods for achieving these goals.},

All geometrical parameters in the Stillinger–Weber potential are determined analytically according to the equilibrium condition for each individual potential term, while the energy parameters are derived from the valence force-field model. This parametrization approach transfers the accuracy of the valence force field model to the Stillinger–Weber potential. Furthermore, the resulting Stilliinger–Weber potential supports stable molecular dynamics simulations, as each potential term is at an energy-minimum state separately at the equilibrium configuration. We employ this procedure to parametrize Stillinger–Weber potentials for single-layer MoS2 and black phosphorous. The obtained Stillinger–Weber potentials predict an accurate phonon spectrum and mechanical behaviors. We also provide input scripts of these Stillinger–Weber potentials used by publicly available simulation packages including GULP and LAMMPS.},

We describe a number of practical and computationally efficient strategies to parametrize traditional force fields for molecular liquids from ML: the particle decomposition ansatz to two- and three-body force fields, the use of kernel-based ML models that incorporate physical symmetries, the incorporation of switching functions close to the cutoff, and the use of covariant meshing to boost the training set size. Results are presented for model molecular liquids: pairwise Lennard-Jones, three-body Stillinger–Weber, and bottom-up coarse-graining of water. Here, covariant meshing proves to be an efficient strategy to learn canonically averaged instantaneous forces. We show that molecular dynamics simulations with tabulated two- and three-body ML potentials are computationally efficient and recover two- and three-body distribution functions. Many-body representations, decomposition, and kernel regression schemes are all implemented in the open-source software package VOTCA.},

The technique uses a Poisson solver to extract the pressure field on a network of data nodes, which is constructed using the Voronoi tessellation and the Delaunay triangulation. The technique is demonstrated on two cases: synthetic Lagrangian data generated for the analytical case of Hill’s spherical vortex, and the flow in the wake behind a NACA 0012 which was impulsively accelerated to \$\$Re = 7\{,\}500\$\$. The experimental data were collected using four-camera, three-dimensional particle-tracking velocimetry. For both the analytical case and the experimental case, the dependence of pressure-field error or sensitivity on the normalized spatial particle density was found to follow similar power-law relationships. It was shown that in order to resolve the salient flow structures from experimental data, the required particle density was an order of magnitude greater than for the analytical case. Furthermore, additional sub-structures continued to be identified in the experimental data as the particle density was increased. The increased density requirements of the experimental data were assumed to be due to a combination of phase-averaging error and the presence of turbulent coherent structures in the flow. Additionally, the computational requirements of the technique were assessed. It was found that in the current implementation, the computational requirements are slightly nonlinear with respect to the number of particles. However, the technique will remain feasible even as advancements in particle-tracking techniques in the future increase the density of Lagrangian data.},

  abstract = {Cellulosic nanomaterials constitute a topic of growing commercial interest for numerous applications, many of which demand a working knowledge of the rheology of the materials. We demonstrate here that aqueous suspensions of micro/nanofibrillated cellulose (MNFC) exhibit complex shear behavior governed primarily by fibrillar floc dynamics. Regimes corresponding to structure formation, persistence, and breakdown are quantitatively differentiated. We assess the recovery of the network structure as a function of the applied breakdown conditions and identify critical conditions that characterize the floc dynamics as isotropic or anisotropic. A two-step yield behavior generates persistent anisotropic flocs that effectively prohibit recovery of the initial gel structure under certain conditions. Processing within this stress window entails a risk of generating heterogeneous, potentially irreproducible structures and properties. An in-depth understanding of the rheology of aqueous MNFC suspensions and their floc-dominated, rather than fibril-dominated, nature is critical to rationally tailoring properties through judicious selection of processing conditions.}

  abstract = {We present detailed results about the structural, conformational, rheo-optical, and topological properties of an entangled of C400H802 linear polyethylene (PE) melt over a wide range of shear rates (covering both the linear and the highly nonlinear viscoelastic regimes) from direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of a large system containing 192 chains (corresponding to 79200 interacting atomistic units). We discuss results for (i) the probability distribution of the mean-square chain end-to-end distance and its radius of gyration, (ii) the conformation tensor, (iii) the material functions in steady shear (viscosity, normal stress differences, nonequilibrium shear compliance, hydrostatic pressure), (iv) the flow birefringence, (v) the orientation angle and order parameter, (vi) the interaction energies and their relative importance, (vii) the intermolecular pair distribution function, and (viii) the intrinsic molecular shape of the chains (represented by the isosurface plots in terms of their monomer number density), all as a function of flow strength. A detailed primitive path (PP) analysis has allowed us to examine how the flow field alters the statistical properties of the underlying topological network of the melt (probability distribution functions and mean values of PP contour length, of the number and size of entanglement strands, etc.). Our results reveal significant distortions of all these distributions due to applied flow. One of the most important results of our work is that as the shear rate is increased, the average value of the contour length goes through a maximum and the number of entanglements per chain exhibits a shear-thinning behavior which bears many similarities with the corresponding behavior of the shear viscosity. Overall, most of the computed rheological properties of the C400H802 melt change in a nonlinear way with the applied shear rate due to the simultaneous effect of (a) chain orientation and stretching, (b) chain rotation and tumbling under shear, and (c) chain disentanglement.}

The frequency-dependent material properties are then correlated with observed changes in the topological network structure. While only minimal structural variations are observed in the elastic regime, a substantial rearrangement occurs in the low frequency, large amplitude viscous regime. Aggregates tend to break apart, resulting in an increased density of free chains. Additionally, the network tends to break and form larger structural elements with an increase multiplicity of chains bridging between the same two aggregates.},

  abstract = {Artificial wrinkles, especially those with responsive erasure/regeneration behaviors have gained extensive interest due to their potential in smart applications. However, current wrinkle modulation methods primarily rely on network rearrangement, causing bottlenecks in in situ wrinkle regeneration. Herein, we report a dually cross-linked network wherein [2]rotaxane cross-link can dissipate stress within the wrinkles through its sliding motion without disrupting the network, and quadruple H-bonding cross-link comparatively highlight the advantages of [2]rotaxane modulation. Acid stimulation dissociates quadruple H-bonding and destructs network, swiftly eliminating the wrinkles. However, the regeneration process necessitates network rearrangement, making in situ recovery unfeasible. By contrast, alkaline stimulation disrupts host–guest recognition, and subsequent intramolecular motion of [2]rotaxane dissipate energy to eliminate wrinkles gradually. The always intact network allows for the in situ recovery of surface microstructures. The responsive behaviors of quadruple H-bonding and mechanical bond are orthogonal, and their combination leads to wrinkles with multiple but accurate responsiveness.},

  abstract = {We present a model-driven predictive scheme for the uniaxial extensional viscosity and strain hardening of branched polymer melts, specifically for the pom-pom architecture, using the small amplitude oscillatory shear mastercurve and the polymer architecture. A pom-pom shaped polymer is the simplest architecture with at least two branching points, needed to induce strain hardening. It consists of two stars, each with \$\$q\$\$arms of the molecular weight \$\$\{M\}\_\{w,a\}\$\$, connected by a backbone of \$\$\{M\}\_\{w,b\}\$\$. Despite the pom-pom constitutive model, experimental data of systematic investigations lack due to synthetic complexity. With an optimized approach, we synthesized polystyrene pom-pom model systems with systematically varied \$\$\{M\}\_\{w,a\}\$\$and \$\$\{M\}\_\{w,b\}\$\$. Experimentally, we identify four characteristic strain rate dependent regimes of the extensional viscosity, which can be predicted from the rheological mastercurve. Furthermore, we find that the industrially important maximum strain hardening factor depends only on the arm number by \$\$[\{q\}\textasciicircum\{2\}/\{\{\{\{\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ln\}\}\}\}\}\}(\{\textbackslash sqrt\{3\}\}q)]\$\$. This framework offers a model-based design of branched polymers with predictable melt flow behavior.},

In these applications, high stretchability, low hysteresis, and anti-fatigue fracture are essential but can be rarely met in the same hydrogels simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a hydrogel design using tandem-repeat proteins as the cross-linkers and random coiled polymers as the percolating network. Such a design allows the polyprotein cross-linkers only to experience considerable forces at the fracture zone and unfold to prevent crack propagation. Thus, we are able to decouple the hysteresis-toughness correlation and create hydrogels of high stretchability (\textasciitilde 1100\%), low hysteresis ({$<$} 5\%), and high fracture toughness (\textasciitilde 900\,J\,m−2). Moreover, the hydrogels show a high fatigue threshold of \textasciitilde 126\,J\,m−2 and can undergo 5000 load-unload cycles up to 500\% strain without noticeable mechanical changes. Our study provides a general route to decouple network elasticity and local mechanical response in synthetic hydrogels.},

The bottleneck lies in the low actuation speed inherently limited by the water diffusion between hydrogels and their surrounding environment. In addition, accessing complex motions is restricted by the material fabrication methods. Here we report a hitherto unknown mechanism to achieve high-speed and programmable actuations for a disulfide crosslinked thermally responsive hydrogel. The dynamic photo-activated disulfide bond exchange allows photo-mechanical programming to introduce spatio-selective network anisotropy. This gives rise to an actuation behavior dominated by thermally driven conformation change of the locally oriented polymer chains instead of the common mass-diffusion-based mechanism. With the incorporation of photothermal fillers, light-powered oscillation at frequencies as high as 1.7\,Hz is realized. This, coupled with the versatility of the programming, allows access to robots with diverse high-speed motions including continuous swimming, step-wise walking, and rotating.},

  abstract = {Thanks to many promising properties, including biocompatibility and the ability to experience large deformations, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels are excellent candidate materials for a wide range of applications. Interestingly, the polymerization of PEGDA leads to a network microstructure that is fundamentally different from that of the “classic” polymeric gels. Specifically, PEGDA hydrogels comprise PEG chains that are interconnected by multifunctional densely grafted rod-like polyacrylates (PAs), which serve as cross-linkers. In this work, we derive a microstructurally motivated model that captures the essential features which enable deformation in PEGDA hydrogels: (1) entropic elasticity of PEG chains, (2) deformation of PA rods, and (3) PA–PA interactions. Expressions for the energy-density functions and the stress associated with each of the three contributions are derived. The model demonstrates the microstructural evolution of the network during loading and reveals the role of key microscopic quantities. To validate the model, we fabricate and compress PEGDA hydrogel discs. The model is in excellent agreement with our experimental findings for a broad range of PEGDA compositions. Interestingly, we show that the response of PEGDA hydrogels with short PEG chains and long PA rods is governed by PA–PA interactions, whereas networks with longer PEG chains are dominated by entropy. To enable design, we employ the model to investigate the influence of key microstructural quantities, such as the length of the PEG and the PA chains, on the macroscopic properties and response. The findings from this work pave the way to the efficient design of PEGDA hydrogels with tunable properties and behaviors, which will enable the optimization of their performance in various applications.},

  abstract = {While photopolymerization has been broadly used to fabricate hydrogels, the kinetics of the structural evolution of such hydrogels during photopolymerization and how the kinetics relate to ultimate hydrogel properties are not well-understood. Herein, small-amplitude oscillatory shear rheology (bulk scale) and time-resolved very small-angle neutron scattering (vSANS, microscale) are used in tandem to investigate the kinetics of the photopolymerization of methacrylated starch building blocks with different concentrations, charges (cationic (+), anionic (−), or neutral (0)), and morphologies (soluble branched starch, starch nanoparticles, or combinations thereof). Starch nanoparticles (SNPs) enabled the fabrication of much denser hydrogels than soluble starch but took longer to gel due to the reduced conformational mobility of the polymerizable methacrylate groups on the SNPs. The addition of charge (cationic or anionic) increases the bulk gelation time while significantly reducing the observed changes in the fluid scale and correlation length, suggesting less covalent crosslinking and inherent SNP deformation during photogelation; indeed, the fluid exponent analysis suggests that charged SNPs deswell upon crosslinking, consistent with the behavior of microgels in colloidal crystals, while uncharged SNPs swell due to competition between inter- and intraparticle crosslinking. The combination of shear rheology and vSANS measurements can thus inform the design of new photopolymerizable hydrogels with targeted comprehensive properties.}

Such models also provide the basis of methods for using rheological data to obtain information about the structure of a polymer whose structure is not known in detail. These models and relationships between structure and rheology are presented here from both phenomenological and molecular-theoretical points of view. This book is intended to be useful to several types of reader. For those who have a basic knowledge of rheology but little experience with polymers, we have provided in the early chapters sufficient information about polymer physics and chemistry for an understanding of the later chapters. For readers who are currently active in polymer rheology and would like to know the state of the art with respect to quantitative relationships between molecular structure and rheology, the later chapters of the book provide this information. Thus, the book provides both an introduction to polymers and rheological concepts as well as an advanced treatment of potential interest both to polymer scientists and plastics engineers.}

Furthermore, we design two complex director fields with twisted nematic domains and nematic disclinations that encode a pattern of folds for an auto-origami box. This actuator will be flat at a reference nematic state and form four well-controlled bend distortions as orientational order changes. Device fabrication is applicable via current experimental techniques.

However, we have recently shown that many-body correlations, in particular, bond orientational correlations, play a key role in both the glass transition and the crystallization transition. Here we show, with numerical simulations of supercooled polydisperse hard spheres systems, that the length-scale associated with any two-point spatial correlation function does not increase toward the glass transition. A growing length-scale is instead revealed by considering many-body correlation functions, such as correlators of orientational order, which follows the length-scale of the dynamic heterogeneities. Despite the growing of crystal-like bond orientational order, we reveal that the stability against crystallization with increasing polydispersity is due to an increasing population of icosahedral arrangements of particles. Our results suggest that, for this type of systems, many-body correlations are a manifestation of the link between the vitrification and the crystallization phenomena. Whether a system is vitrified or crystallized can be controlled by the degree of frustration against crystallization, polydispersity in this case.},

We show the usefulness of this approach by studying the cases of sodium and aluminum that crystallize in the bcc and fcc crystalline structures, respectively. Using these two generic collective variables, we perform variationally enhanced sampling and well tempered metadynamics simulations and find that the systems transform spontaneously and reversibly between the liquid and the solid phases.},

  abstract = {Bottlebrush polymers, formed from a linear backbone polymer with a high density of grafted side chains, are functional macromolecules useful in molecular assembly and responsive materials due to their unique physical properties. Interactions between the side chains stiffen the molecular backbone and imbue it with a molecular dimension beyond simply the polymer length, drastically altering dynamic relaxation and intrapolymer interactions. Simulation prediction of these material properties remains a challenge, however, because they specifically depend on side chain degrees of freedom that are computationally expensive to model. In this work, we use the wormlike cylinder framework to systematically map molecular features from a single-molecule hybrid Brownian dynamics and Monte Carlo (BD/MC) simulation with explicit side chains to a simple touched-bead polymer model. We use static properties from the explicit side chain simulations such as end-to-end distance and radius of gyration to parameterize the wormlike cylinder model and consistently reproduce other single-chain properties such as hydrodynamic radius and intrinsic viscosity. This parameterization yields the stiffness parameter and equivalent diameter of a bottlebrush and is compared to prior scaling theories and simulation results. We find that the wormlike cylinder model, appropriately parameterized, provides an accurate description of these quantities over a wide range of side chain lengths and grafting densities. We demonstrate that a coarse-grained representation is able to consistently reproduce the bottlebrush structure and show that the wormlike cylinder model can be useful for large-scale coarse-grained simulations of bottlebrush suspensions.}

A systematic investigation into the structure and mechanical properties of PEGDM hydrogels was performed to characterize the relationships between the network structure and gel properties. Gels were prepared from oligomers of different molecular masses (1000−8000 g/mol) at various concentrations. Small-angle neutron scattering was used to characterize the structural features of hydrogels with respect to their semidilute solution precursors. A well-defined structural length scale manifested as a maximum in the scattering intensity was observed for hydrogels derived from high molecular mass PEGDMs and/or high oligomer mass fractions. Mechanical testing showed that PEGDM hydrogels are mechanically robust, consistent with gel structures that contain reinforcing cross-linked clusters. Shear moduli were determined for hydrogels swollen to various degrees in water. The concentration dependence of shear modulus for these nonideal hydrogels exhibits a power law behavior with an exponent close to 1/3.}

In this work, we show that PEG-based hydrogels prepared by photopolymerization of PEG macromonomers functionalized with either acrylate or acrylamide end-groups generate networks with cross-link junctions of high functionality. Although the cross-link functionality is not well controlled, the resultant networks are sufficiently well ordered to generate a distinct correlation peak in the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) related to the distance between cross-link junctions within the PEG network. The cross-link spacing is a useful probe of the PEG chain conformation within the hydrogel and ranges from approximately 6 to 16 nm, dependent upon both the volume fraction of polymer and the molecular weight of the PEG macromonomers. The presence of a peak in the scattering of photopolymerized PEG networks is also correlated with an enhanced compressive modulus in comparison to PEG networks reported in the literature with much lower cross-link functionality that exhibit no scattering peak. This comparison demonstrates that the method used to link together PEG macromonomers has a critical impact on both the nanoscale structure and the macroscopic properties of the resultant hydrogel network.},

  abstract = {The penetration of water into rubber-like protein networks such as cross-linked resilin, which is found in insects, can lead to changes in stiffness that range over several orders of magnitude. This softening effect cannot be explained by the volumetric changes associated with pure swelling/deswelling used to describe networks with covalent bonds. Rather, this property stems from the reversible swelling-induced breaking of hydrogen cross-linking bonds that connect the chains in the network. This work presents a model for the swelling and the mechanical response of hydrogen-bond dominated biopolymer networks. It is shown that the penetration of water molecules into the network leads to the breaking of non-covalent cross-linking sites. In turn, the network experiences a reduction in the effective chain-density, an increase in entropy, and a consequent decrease in free energy, thus explaining the dramatic softening. Additionally, the breaking of hydrogen bonds alters the micro-structure and changes the quantitative elastic behavior of the network. The proposed model is found to be in excellent agreement with several experimental findings. The merit of the work is twofold in that it (1) accounts for the number and the strength of non-covalent cross-linking bonds, thus explaining the drastic reduction in stiffness upon water uptake, and (2) provides a method to characterize the micro-structural evolution of hydrogen-bond dominated networks. Consequently, the model can be used as a micro-structural design-guide to program the response of synthetic polymers. Statement of Significance Hydrogen-bond dominated biopolymer networks are found in insects and have a unique structure that allows a dramatic reduction of several orders of magnitude in stiffness upon hydration. Understanding the micro-structure of such networks is key in the fabrication of new biomimetic polymers with tunable mechanical properties. This work introduces a microscopically motivated model that explains the dramatic reduction in stiffness and quantifies the influence of key micro-structural quantities on the overall response. The model is validated through several experimental findings. The insights from this work motivate further attempts at the fabrication of new biomimetic polymers and serve as a micro-structural design guide that enables the programming of the elastic swelling-induced response.},

  abstract = {Dynamic oscillatory shear tests are common in rheology and have been used to investigate a wide range of soft matter and complex fluids including polymer melts and solutions, block copolymers, biological macromolecules, polyelectrolytes, surfactants, suspensions, emulsions and beyond. More specifically, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) tests have become the canonical method for probing the linear viscoelastic properties of these complex fluids because of the firm theoretical background [1], [2], [3], [4] and the ease of implementing suitable test protocols. However, in most processing operations the deformations can be large and rapid: it is therefore the nonlinear material properties that control the system response. A full sample characterization thus requires well-defined nonlinear test protocols. Consequently there has been a recent renewal of interest in exploiting large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) tests to investigate and quantify the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of complex fluids. In terms of the experimental input, both LAOS and SAOS require the user to select appropriate ranges of strain amplitude (γ0) and frequency (ω). However, there is a distinct difference in the analysis of experimental output, i.e. the material response. At sufficiently large strain amplitude, the material response will become nonlinear in LAOS tests and the familiar material functions used to quantify the linear behavior in SAOS tests are no longer sufficient. For example, the definitions of the linear viscoelastic moduli G′(ω) and G″(ω) are based inherently on the assumption that the stress response is purely sinusoidal (linear). However, a nonlinear stress response is not a perfect sinusoid and therefore the viscoelastic moduli are not uniquely defined; other methods are needed for quantifying the nonlinear material response under LAOS deformation. In the present review article, we first summarize the typical nonlinear responses observed with complex fluids under LAOS deformations. We then introduce and critically compare several methods that quantify the nonlinear oscillatory stress response. We illustrate the utility and sensitivity of these protocols by investigating the nonlinear response of various complex fluids over a wide range of frequency and amplitude of deformation, and show that LAOS characterization is a rigorous test for rheological models and advanced quality control.},

Using the Flory–Rehner free energy that does not predict phase separation of hydrogels under equilibrium free swelling, we show that mechanical constraints can lead to coexistence of multiple phases. We systematically obtain the states of equilibrium for hydrogels under various mechanical constraints and unravel how mechanical constraints change the convexity of the free energy and monotonicity of the stress–stretch curves, leading to phase coexistence. Using a phase-field model, we predict the pattern evolution of phase coexistence and show that many features cannot be captured by the homogeneous states of equilibrium due to large mismatch stretch between the coexisting phases. We further reveal that the system size, quenching rate, and loading rate can significantly influence the phase behavior, which provides insights for experimental studies related to morphological patterns of hydrogels.},

  abstract = {Dynamic polymer networks utilize weak bonding interactions to dissipate the stored energy and provide a source of self-healing for the material. Due to this, tracking the progression of damage in these networks is poorly understood as it becomes necessary to distinguish between reversible and irreversible bond detachment (by kinetic bond exchange or chain rupture, respectively). In this work, we present a statistical formulation based on the transient network theory to track the chain conformation space of a dynamic polymer network whose chains rupture after being pulled past a critical stretch. We explain the predictions of this model by the observable material timescales of relaxation and self-healing, which are related to the kinetic rates of attachment and detachment. We demonstrate our model to match experimental data of cyclic loading and self-healing experiments, providing physical interpretation for these complex behaviors in dynamic polymer networks.}

In particular, we discuss how features of the volume phase transition of the gel’s osmotic equilibrium are analogous to other transitions described by mean-field models of binary mixtures, and the failure of this analogy at the critical point due to shear rigidity. We then consider the phase transition at fixed volume, a relatively unexplored paradigm for polymer gels that results in a phaseseparated equilibrium consisting of coexisting solvent-rich and solvent-poor regions of gel. Again, the gel’s shear rigidity is found to have a profound effect on the phase transition, here resulting in macroscopic shape change at constant volume of the sample, exemplified by the tunable buckling of toroidal samples of polymer gel. By drawing analogies with extreme mechanics, where large shape changes are achieved via mechanical instabilities, we formulate the notion of extreme thermodynamics, where large shape changes are achieved via thermodynamic instabilities, i.e.phase transitions.},

In addition, for specific state points, numerical simulations revealed that diamond-like networks reach the limit of mechanical stability, exhibiting values of ν = −1, a condition that we define as hyper-auxeticity. This behavior is interesting per se for its consequences in materials science but is also appealing for fundamental physics because the mechanical instability is accompanied by evidence of criticality. In this work, we deepen our understanding of this phenomenon by performing a large set of equilibrium and stress–strain simulations in combination with phenomenological elasticity theory. The two approaches are found to be in good agreement, confirming the above results. We also extend our investigations to disordered polymer networks and find that the hyper-auxetic behavior also holds in this case, still manifesting a similar critical-like behavior as in the diamond one. Finally, we highlight the role of the number density, which is found to be a relevant control parameter determining the elastic properties of the system. The validity of the results under disordered conditions paves the way for an experimental investigation of this phenomenon in real systems, such as hydrogels.},

At low temperatures the experimentally determined form factors and the simulated density profiles indicate a loose internal particle structure with an extended corona that can be modeled as a starlike object. With increasing temperature across the volumetric phase transition, the form factor develops an inflection that, using simulations, is interpreted as arising from a conformation in which PEG chains are incorporated in the interior of the PNIPAM network. This gives rise to a peculiar density profile characterized by two dense, separated regions, at odds with configurations in which the PEG chains reside on the surface of the PNIPAM core. The conformation of the PEG chains also have profound effects on the interparticle interactions: Although chains on the surface reduce the solvophobic attraction typically experienced by PNIPAM particles at high temperatures, PEG chains inside the PNIPAM network shift the onset of attractive interaction at even lower temperatures. Our results show that by tuning the morphology of the composite microgels, we can qualitatively change both their structure and their mutual interactions, opening the way to explore new collective behaviors of these objects.},

  abstract = {By means of Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate the gel formation of randomly functionalized polymers in solution, with the ability to form both intra- and intermolecular reversible bonds. Under highly dilute conditions, these polymers form soft nano-objects (so-called single-chain nanoparticles, SCNPs), resulting from the purely intramolecular cross-linking of the reactive functional groups. Here, we show that the competition between intra- and intermolecular bonds at finite concentration is governed by a delicate balance of various entropic contributions and leads to a density-dependent effective valence. System-spanning networks are formed at relatively low monomer densities and their stability is mediated by just a small number of intermolecular connections per chain. The formation of intermolecular bonds furthermore can induce a nonmonotonic dependence of the polymer size on the density for long bond lifetimes. Concomitantly, the polymers in the percolating cluster adopt an intramolecular structure characteristic for self-avoiding chains, which constitutes a strong contrast to the fractal globular behavior of intramolecularly cross-linked SCNPs in crowded solutions with purely topological interactions (no intermolecular bonds). Finally, we study the dynamics of the system, which displays signatures expected for reversible gel-forming systems. An interesting behavior emerges in the reorganization dynamics of the percolating cluster: the relaxation is mostly mediated by the diffusion over long distances, through breaking and formation of bonds, of chains that do not leave the percolating cluster. Regarding the few chains that are transiently free, the time they spend until they reattach to the cluster is solely governed by the bond strength.},

  abstract = {Deformable colloids and macromolecules adsorb at interfaces as they decrease the interfacial energy between the two media. The deformability, or softness, of these particles plays a pivotal role in the properties of the interface. In this study, we employ a comprehensive in situ approach, combining neutron reflectometry with molecular dynamics simulations, to thoroughly examine the profound influence of softness on the structure of microgel Langmuir monolayers under compression. Lateral compression of both hard and soft microgel particle monolayers induces substantial structural alterations, leading to an amplified protrusion of the microgels into the aqueous phase. However, a critical distinction emerges: hard microgels are pushed away from the interface, in stark contrast to the soft ones, which remain firmly anchored to it. Concurrently, on the air-exposed side of the monolayer, lateral compression induces a flattening of the surface of the hard monolayer. This phenomenon is not observed for the soft particles as the monolayer is already extremely flat even in the absence of compression. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the key role of softness on both the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer and its effect when soft colloids are used as stabilizers of responsive interfaces and emulsions.},

  abstract = {The structural characterization of microgels at interfaces is fundamental to understand both their 2D phase behavior and their role as stabilizers that enable emulsions to be broken on demand. However, this characterization is usually limited by available experimental techniques, which do not allow a direct investigation at interfaces. To overcome this difficulty, here we employ neutron reflectometry, which allows us to probe the structure and responsiveness of the microgels in-situ at the air-water interface. We investigate two types of microgels with different cross-link density, thus having different softness and deformability, both below and above their volume phase transition temperature, by~combining experiments with computer simulations of in silico synthesized microgels. We find that temperature only affects the portion of microgels in water, while the strongest effect of the microgels softness is observed in their ability to protrude into the air. In particular, standard microgels have an apparent contact angle of few degrees, while ultra-low cross-linked microgels form a flat polymeric layer with zero contact angle. Altogether, this study provides an in-depth microscopic description of how different microgel architectures affect their arrangements at interfaces, and will be the foundation for a better understanding of their phase behavior and assembly.},

  abstract = {Although microgels have been widely used as model systems for soft colloids, their properties are still far from being completely understood. This stems from their heterogeneous structure strongly differing from that of an idealized polymeric network. Indeed, microgels synthesized by conventional precipitation polymerization exhibit not only a fuzzy structure with respect to the difference of reactivity between monomers and cross-linker molecules but also static heterogeneities related to the distribution in the length of the chains constituting their network. These features can be reproduced in computer simulations using the so-called in silico synthesis. Hereby, a designing force acting on the cross-linkers during the in silico synthesis allows us to finely adjust the radial density distribution and, thus, to reproduce both the fuzziness and local heterogeneities present in real microgel systems. In this study, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels were synthesized with different degrees of cross-linking ccross down to cross-linker free conditions corresponding to so-called ultralow cross-linked microgels (ULC microgels). The experimental characterization was accompanied by numerical simulations at different ccross with the same designing force, which is found to be independent of the cross-linker concentration, as well as the size of the microgels. For the ULC microgels, it was found that no designing force is needed, but the number density of the network is much smaller. The number of effective cross-linkers in this case is found to be ∼0.1\%. The form factors of all microgels were measured at different temperatures across their volume phase transition with both static light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering, favorably comparing them to the simulated ones. Furthermore, the swelling behavior was experimentally determined by dynamic light scattering and viscosimetry and also compared to the simulated results. Finally, experimental and simulated results indicate that the cross-linking dependence of the swelling is well-described by theoretical predictions for the isotropic swelling of an ideal network despite the highly heterogeneous character of real microgels.}

  abstract = {We investigate by means of small angle neutron scattering experiments and numerical simulations the interactions and inter-particle arrangements of concentrated dispersions of copolymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)–poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate) (PNIPAM–PEGMA) microgels across the volume phase transition (VPT). The scattering data of moderately concentrated dispersions are accurately modeled at all temperatures by using a star polymer form factor and static structure factors calculated from the effective potential obtained from simulations. Interestingly, for temperatures below the VPT temperature (VPTT), the radius of gyration and blob size of the particles significantly decrease with increasing the effective packing fraction in the non-overlapping regime. This is attributed to the presence of charges in the system associated with the use of an ionic initiator in the synthesis. Simulations using the experimentally corroborated interaction potential are used to explore the state diagram in a wide range of effective packing fractions. Below and slightly above the VPTT, the system undergoes an arrest transition mainly driven by the soft repulsion between the particles. Only well above the VPTT the system is found to phase separate before arresting. Our results highlight the versatility and potential of copolymer PNIPAM–PEGMA microgels to explore different kinds of arrested states balancing attraction and repulsion by changing temperature and packing fraction.},

  abstract = {The protein dynamical transition marks an increase in atomic mobility and the onset of anharmonic motions at a critical temperature (Td), which is considered relevant for protein functionality. This phenomenon is ubiquitous, regardless of protein composition, structure and biological function and typically occurs at large protein content, to avoid water crystallization. Recently, a dynamical transition has also been reported in non-biological macromolecules, such as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels, bearing many similarities to proteins. While the generality of this phenomenon is well-established, the role of water in the transition remains a subject of debate. In this study, we use atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and elastic incoherent neutron scattering (EINS) experiments with selective deuteration to investigate the microscopic origin of the dynamical transition and distinguish water and PNIPAM roles. While a standard analysis of EINS experiments would suggest that the dynamical transition occurs in PNIPAM and water at a similar temperature, simulations reveal a different perspective, also qualitatively supported by experiments. From room temperature down to about 180 K, PNIPAM exhibits only modest changes of dynamics, while water, being mainly hydration water under the probed extreme confinement, significantly slows down and undergoes a mode-coupling transition from diffusive to activated. Our findings therefore challenge the traditional view of the dynamical transition, demonstrating that it occurs in proximity of the water mode-coupling transition, shedding light on the intricate interplay between polymer and water dynamics.},
