  abstract = {Hydrogels are widely used in the development of bioinks for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting (EBB). The rheological properties of these materials have already been studied extensively in the literature, and characteristics such as shear-thinning, yield stress and quick structural recovery upon flow cessation are deemed key properties to obtain bioinks of superior performance in EBB. However, there are still inconsistencies in the usage of shear rheology for the characterization of hydrogels for EBB. Therefore, this review discusses the rheometrical techniques applied to the development and characterization of inks for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting. More specifically, the focus will be on the applicability of shear rheometry in EBB as well as important underlying rheological concepts. Rheological tests were categorized according to the nature of the applied stimuli during rheometrical testing, e.g., continuous or oscillatory shear rheometry. In the first class of tests, the flow curves and the shear-thinning behaviour of Power-law fluids are tackled, and the relevance of this effect is discussed in the context of EBB and cell viability. The importance of rapid structural recovery of the material after shear-thinning is illustrated with examples. Then, the Herschel-Bulkley model for yield stress fluids and their connection with improved shape fidelity is highlighted. Oscillatory tests, such as amplitude-, frequency-, temperature- and time-sweeps, and their most relevant applications in EBB, such as gel strength and flowability, gel/liquid-like states, transition temperatures and processing temperatures, and equilibrium modulus after crosslinking are closely reviewed. In addition, relationships between rheological testing and the determination of process parameters are given in a section dedicated to the flow characteristics in EBB. Finally, we offer some future directions for rheology of EBB inks, aiming at the conception of next-generation bioinks.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the numerical computation of the two-dimensional flow of yield stress fluids (with Bingham and Herschel--Bulkley models) based on a variational approach and a finite element discretization. The main goal of this paper is to propose an alternative optimization method to existing procedures such as penalization and augmented Lagrangian techniques. It is shown that the minimum principle for Bingham and Herschel--Bulkley yield stress fluid steady flows can, indeed, be formulated as a secondorder cone programming (SOCP) problem, for which very efficient primal--dual interior point solvers are available. In particular, the formulation does not require any regularization of the visco-plastic model as is usually the case for existing techniques, avoiding therefore the difficult choice of the regularization parameter. Besides, it is also unnecessary to adopt a mixed stress--velocity approach or discretize explicitly auxiliary variables as frequently proposed in existing methods. Finally, the performance of dedicated SOCP solvers, like the MOSEK software package, enables us to solve large-scale problems on a personal computer within seconds only. The proposed method will be validated on classical benchmark examples and used to simulate the flow generated around a plate during its withdrawal from a bath of yield stress fluid.},

Different slip models relating the wall shear stress to the slip velocity are employed. In the case of non-monotonic slip models with a maximum followed by a minimum, there exist linearly unstable steady-state solutions with one or both the slip velocities along the inner and outer cylinders of the annulus corresponding to the (unstable) negative-slope branch of the slip equation. The resulting flow curve is non-monotonic with one or even two narrow unstable branches corresponding to the stick--slip instability regime. The sizes of these two unstable regimes are reduced as the radii ratio is reduced. It is demonstrated that the second unstable branch may not be observed at all due to the presence of stable steady-states. These results provide a partial explanation for the absence of the stick--slip instability in annular extrusion experiments.},

  abstract = {We solve numerically the cessation of axisymmetric Poiseuille flow of a Herschel--Bulkley fluid under the assumption that slip occurs along the wall. The Papanastasiou regularization of the constitutive equation is employed. As for the slip equation, a power-law expression is used to relate the wall shear stress to the slip velocity, assuming that slip occurs only above a critical wall shear stress, known as the slip yield stress. It is shown that, when the latter is zero, the fluid slips at all times, the velocity becomes and remains uniform before complete cessation, and the stopping time is finite only when the slip exponent s{$<$}1. In the case of Navier slip (s=1), the stopping time is infinite for any non-zero Bingham number and the volumetric flow rate decays exponentially. When s{$>$}1, the decay is much slower. Analytical expressions of the decay of the flat velocity for any value of s and of the stopping time for s{$<$}1 are also derived. Using a discontinuous slip equation with slip yield stress poses numerical difficulties even in one dimensional time-dependent flows, since the transition times from slip to no-slip and vice versa are not known a priori. This difficulty is overcome by regularizing the slip equation. The numerical results showed that when the slip yield stress is non-zero, slip ceases at a finite critical time, the velocity becomes flat only in complete cessation, and the stopping times are finite, in agreement with theoretical estimates.},

The constitutive equation is regularized as proposed by Papanastasiou. In addition, we propose a new regularized slip equation which is valid uniformly at any wall shear stress level by means of another regularization parameter. Four different flow regimes are observed defined by three critical values of the pressure gradient. Initially no slip occurs, in the second regime slip occurs only in the middle of the wider wall, in the third regime slip occurs partially at both walls, and eventually variable slip occurs everywhere. The performance of the regularized slip equation in the two intermediate regimes in which wall slip is partial has been tested for both Newtonian and Bingham flows. The convergence of the results with the Papanastasiou regularization parameter has been also studied. The combined effects of viscoplasticity and slip are then investigated. Results are presented for wide ranges of the Bingham and slip numbers and for various values of the power-law exponent and the duct aspect ratio. These compare favorably with available theoretical results and with numerical results in the literature obtained with both regularization and augmented Lagrangian methods.},

After a survey of these results, the friction model is derived for the extrusion process. All calculations are as simple as possible: two-dimensional, Newtonian, isothermal, and with constant boundary layer parameters of coefficients of friction. A strong dependence of pumping characteristics and efficiency on the slip boundary conditions, and also on the extruder length in the case of friction, was found, especially when slip is only allowed for at the screw surface. Exercises like these may help in understanding abnormal extrusion behavior of slippery materials in practice.},

Experimental extrusion force was correlated with simulated extrusion force; adequate agreement was noted (R2~=~0.98). Pressure suitable for 3D printing of the gels was determined, being lower than 200~kPa for the tested gels. The extrusion curves indicate that there exists a buffer time after which each gel would start to flow. An increase in the gel water content and a decrease in the nozzle diameter increase the extrusion force and the buffer time.

  abstract = {The present study is concerned with the Marsh cone, a workability test used for specification and quality control of cement pastes and grouts. It is demonstrated here that, under several consistency and geometry conditions, the flow time reflecting ``fluidity'' may be calculated from the plastic viscosity and yield stress in the case of a Bingham fluid and from the cone geometry. A relation between the behaviour parameters and the flow time of fresh pastes tested is derived and experimentally validated. A practical application of these results is suggested. Lastly, the concept of a new test apparatus based on two cones is presented and tested on a single cement paste.},

Die swelling is considered a critical phenomenon in polymer extrusion process affected by melt flow rate, extruder temperature and its geometry. In this research, the ABS melt polymer behavior in the extrusion process of FDM and the die swell of extruded polymer have been investigated by empirical experiments and simulated by the Finite Element Method (FEM) using rheological properties of ABS. The internal geometry of the nozzle is investigated via analytical simulation and finite element analysis to obtain pressure and velocity distributions of the material inside the extruder as well as the die swell of extruded filament. Additionally, experiments were carried out to validate the analytical and numerical simulations. The results showed that higher melt temperature and lower material flow rate result in less pressure drop inside the nozzle and less swelling of the extruded filament.},

  abstract = {Due to their unique structural and mechanical properties, randomly cross-linked polymer networks play an important role in many different fields, ranging from cellular biology to industrial processes. In order to elucidate how these properties are controlled by the physical details of the network (e.g., chain-length and end-to-end distributions), we generate disordered phantom networks with different cross-linker concentrations C and initial densities {$\rho$}init and evaluate their elastic properties. We find that the shear modulus computed at the same strand concentration for networks with the same C, which determines the number of chains and the chain-length distribution, depends strongly on the preparation protocol of the network, here controlled by {$\rho$}init. We rationalize this dependence by employing a generic stress-strain relation for polymer networks that does not rely on the specific form of the polymer end-to-end distance distribution. We find that the shear modulus of the networks is a nonmonotonic function of the density of elastically active strands, and that this behavior has a purely entropic origin. Our results show that if short chains are abundant, as it is always the case for randomly cross-linked polymer networks, the knowledge of the exact chain conformation distribution is essential for correctly predicting the elastic properties. Finally, we apply our theoretical approach to literature experimental data, qualitatively confirming our interpretations.},

  abstract = {The elasticity of disordered and polydisperse polymer networks is a fundamental problem of soft matter physics that is still open. Here, we self-assemble polymer networks via simulations of a mixture of bivalent and tri- or tetravalent patchy particles, which result in an exponential strand length distribution analogous to that of experimental randomly cross-linked systems. After assembly, the network connectivity and topology are frozen and the resulting system is characterized. We find that the fractal structure of the network depends on the number density at which the assembly has been carried out, but that systems with the same mean valence and same assembly density have the same structural properties. Moreover, we compute the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement, also known as the (squared) localization length, of the cross-links and of the middle monomers of the strands, showing that the dynamics of long strands is well described by the tube model. Finally, we find a relation connecting these two localization lengths at high density and connect the cross-link localization length to the shear modulus of the system.},

  abstract = {Squeeze flow between closely spaced parallel disks of a plastic material is considered for a Bingham fluid described by a bi-viscosity model with Navier slip condition. The flow field is divided into a Newtonian part with high viscous Newtonian fluid and a bi-viscosity part with yielded/unyielded fluids. The radial velocities and pressure gradients in the two parts are obtained, respectively. The slip velocity at the disk is proportional to the pressure gradient, which is proportional to r in the Newtonian part and is approximately proportional to large r in the bi-viscosity part. Furthermore, the explicit expressions of the pressure and the squeeze force are acquired through the approximately linear relationship between the pressure gradient and r in the bi-viscosity part. Also, distributions of the radial velocity and shear stress, and the effects of the slip coefficient, plastic viscosity and viscosity ratio on the radial velocity, pressure gradient, squeeze force and yield surface are discussed.},

  abstract = {Development of 3D food printing applications requires in-depth knowledge on printing behaviour of food materials. In extrusion-based 3D printing, rheological properties of a recipe are critical to achieve successful printing. The objective of this research is to investigate potential correlations between printability of formulations and simple rheological properties. We used tomato paste as a model system to investigate the correlation between printing stability, dispensability and rheological properties. The results show a linear correlation between ingredient's flow stress, zero shear viscosity and corresponding printing stability. The extrusion pressure necessary to extrude tomato paste increased linearly with increasing flow stress. More experiments with other aqueous-based food formulations indicated that their printability aligned reasonably well with the correlation of tomato paste; however, for fat-based products different printing behaviour was observed. Finally, we propose a rational guideline for developing aqueous food recipes with desired printability based on flow stress measured by shear rheology.},
