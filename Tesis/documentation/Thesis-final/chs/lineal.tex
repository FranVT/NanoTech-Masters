The mass and the diamater of the particles are set.
The energy it is also set.
The time is a free parameter.

By rescaling the mass, the length and setting $k_B$ to 1 we only have two free parameters to keep the equality, energy and time.
Since $k_B T$ has units of energy, it is more practical so set the energy in terms of the bond energy, leaving free the time parameter.
