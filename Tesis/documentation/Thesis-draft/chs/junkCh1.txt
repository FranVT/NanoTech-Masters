\subsection{Structure and mechanical response}

\paragraph{Covalent Adaptable Networks} Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are produce by incroporating dynamic covalent bonds into convalent polymer networks, which alows for stimulus-induced reconfiguration of networks to reduce stresses or heal damage.
As a result, CANs not only exhibit the robust mechanical properties typical of thermosets but they can also possess the processability and relaxation behavior of thermoplastics.
Depending on the exchange mechanism, CANs may be further classified into two groups: dissociative CANs and associative CANs\citep{guPolymerNetworksPlastics2020}\footnote{A distinguishing characteristic between dissociative and associative CANs is that associative CANs display a constant crosslinking density with respect to temperature.
Since the rate of stress relaxation of these networks depends on the rate of bond rearrangement, the associative bond exchange mechanism is reflected in a viscosity with Arrhenius-like temperature dependence (Figure 9 C).

\paragraph{Microporus Polymer Networks} Microporous materials are defined as materials containing interconnected pores of less than 2 nm in diameter on average. 
Due to their large surface area, many conventional microporous materials (e.g., zeolites, activated carbons) are widely used as catalysts, sorbents, and separation membranes. 


Due to their strong bonds, covalent polymer networks possess high mechanical strength across a wide range of conditions. 

While such mechanical stability enables their use in daily life, 

Many emerging applications and environmental sustainability concerns demand unconventional properties of polymernetworks, such as reprocessability, repairability upon damage, and adaptability to different environments.


Polymer networks with rapid stress relaxation that can heal when damaged (“self-healing”) are often constructed from non-covalent network bonds (e.g., metal–ligand coordination, host–guest interactions, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions) that facilitate energy dissipation and structural reorganization.

\paragraph{How crosslinking affects the mechanical response}

These include one-step procedures like polymerization and parallel cross-linking of multifunctional monomers, as well as multiple step procedures involving synthesis of polymer molecules having reactive groups and their subsequent cross-linking, possibly also by reacting polymers with suitable cross-linking agents\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}. 

The polymer engineer can design and synthesize polymer networks with molecular-scale control over structure such as cross-linking density and with tailored properties, such as biodegradation, mechanical strength, and chemical and biological response to stimuli\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}.

In general, the three integral parts of the hydrogels preparation are monomer, initiator, and cross-linker. 
To control the heat of polymerization and the final hydrogels properties, diluents can be used, such as water or other aqueous solutions\citep{ahmedHydrogelPreparationCharacterization2015a}. 
Then, the hydrogel mass needs to be washed to remove impurities left from the preparation process\citep{ahmedHydrogelPreparationCharacterization2015a}. 
These include nonreacted monomer, initiators, cross-linkers, and unwanted products produced via side reactions\citep{ahmedHydrogelPreparationCharacterization2015a}.

Crosslinking is another essential process that can be controlled and intentionally modified using ionizing radiations\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}.

cross-linked polymer

In general, the cross-linkers increases the molecular weight of the polymer chains, which, in turn, limits their translational movement and decreases the solubility of the polymer\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}.

Controlling the crosslinking process with ionizing radiations can be achieved by maniipulating various parameters during exposure, such as exposure time of radiaiton, frquency, temperature and pressure\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}.




-------------------------------------------------

Hydrogels have received considerable attention in the past 50 years, due to their exceptional promise in wide range of applications [2–4]\citep{ahmedHydrogelPreparationCharacterization2015a}. 

They possess also a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their large water content\citep{ahmedHydrogelPreparationCharacterization2015a}.

Recently, hydrogels have been defined as two- or multicomponent systems consisting of a three-dimensional network of polymer chains and water that fills the space between macromolecules\citep{ahmedHydrogelPreparationCharacterization2015a}.

Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that can absorb and retain large amounts of water while maintaining their structure\footnote{Their ability to retain a large amount of water is due to their 3D structure, which gives them a gel-like appearance and behaviour.}\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}. 

Crosslinkers play a crucial role in providing secondary interactions with biological tissues, and the presence of hydrophilic groups in the polymer chains enhances water uptake [10]\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}. 

These methods allow researchers to create hydrogels with specific properties suitable for various applications such as tissue engineering, biomedicine, and sensing\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}. 
The properties of hydrogels can be tailored based on the nature and arrangement of their constituent monomers, as well as the preparation method employed\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}.


\textbf{Types of Hydrogels} or classification

From\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Natural Polymer: 
            Natural polymer-derived hydrogels, sourced from plants or animals like polysaccharides and proteins.
            These hydrogels are adept at absorbing and retaining water, effectively managing pesticide release in soil to boost efficacy and minimize environmental harm caused by excessive application.
            Despite challenges like mechanical strength variations inherent in natural sources, natural polymer-derived hydrogels hold great promise for sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation.
            Examples: Cellulose, derivatives such as crboxymethyl celluose, Chitosan, Sodium alginate
    \item Synthetic Polymer: 
            Synthetic polymer hydrogels, such as those made from polyacrylamide (PAM) and PVA.
            controllable structures, mechanical strength, and chemical stability.
            PAM is especially favoured for its water retention and non-toxic nature, making it prevalent in biomedicines and agriculture. 
            However, the use of PAM comes with concerns. 
            Acrylamide, used in PAM synthesis, is potentially neurotoxic and may release unreacted particles, posing environmental and health risks. 
            Additionally, these hydrogels have low biodegradability, causing environmental residues and potential contamination. 
            Production of these synthetic polymers often involves harmful chemicals, increasing costs and raising further health and environmental concerns
    \item Natural-Synthetic Polymer: 
            blending natural polymers like alginate and xanthan gum with synthetic counterparts such as PAM and PVA.
            These hydrogels enhance biodegradability and biocompatibility, mitigate long-term soil and water contamination risks, and provide robust mechanical strength and chemical stability.
