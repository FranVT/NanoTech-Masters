  abstract = {Tuning the solubility of fuzzy polymer microgels by external triggers, such as temperature or pH, provides a unique mechanism for controlling the porosity and size of colloidal particles on the nanoscale. As a consequence, these smart microgel particles are being considered for applications ranging from viscosity modifiers and sensing to drug delivery and as models for the glass and the jamming transition. Despite their widespread use, little is known about how these soft particles adapt their shape and size under strong mechanical compression. We use a combination of precise labeling protocols and two-color superresolution microscopy to unravel the behavior of tracer microgels inside densely packed soft solids. We find that interpenetration and shape deformation are dominant until, in the highly overpacked state, this mechanism saturates and the only remaining way to further densify the system is by isotropic compression.},

Microgels are among the most studied colloidal and polymeric systems of the past two decades (1–4). 

In particular, microgels made from thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and its derivatives are of interest (5).
By decorating and functionalizing microgels with nanoparticles, one can add additional optical, chemical, or magnetic sensitivity (6–9).

Swelling the microgel by lowering the temperature can drive a colloidal suspension from the liquid to the solid state, conveniently crossing the glass and the jamming transition without the need to prepare samples of varying composition (10–13).

microgels can be highly overpacked, meaning that the effective volume fraction zeff can be much larger than one (10, 17, 18)


To understand the microstructural changes at high packing densities, it is important to be aware of the complex architecture of individual colloidal microgel particles. 
In microgels, the internal cross-link density is not homogeneous, and moreover, microgels have a fuzzy corona with dangling polymer chains (23). 

The brush-like interactions mediated by these dangling ends can have a profound influence on the onset of repulsive interactions when the microgels swell into contact (11). 
The low-density polymer corona may also allow for deformation and even some mutual interpenetration between adjacent microgels (24). 
Thus, the architecture of swollen microgels permits different competing packing mechanisms such as shape deformation, interpenetration, and compression. 

The main goal of our work is to quantify their relative contribution by nanoscale imaging microgels based on dSTORM (direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) superresolution microscopy (19, 25, 26). 
To this end, we fluorescently label a small subset of microgels and record ultrahigh-resolution two-dimensional (2D) optical image sections. 
The combination of precise labeling protocols and superresolution techniques allows us to map out the different contributions from the marginally jammed state to the deeply overpacked regime. 


# Results

## Microgel properties 

Although the microgels investigated in this study are about 1 mm in diameter, the structural transformations we aim to characterize, as a function of packing density, occur on a significantly smaller length scale.
