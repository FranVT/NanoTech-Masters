  abstract = {An account of the preparation and characterization of temperature-sensitive aqueous microgels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) was first published in 1986. Since then there has been a steady increase in the number of publications describing preparation, characterization and applications of temperature-sensitive microgels. This paper reviews the important developments in the area of temperature-sensitive aqueous microgels over the last decade. Although most of the work involves gels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), other polymers are also considered. Core--shell latex particles exhibiting temperature-sensitive properties are also described.},

The core dominates light scattering turbidity behavior whereas the colloid stability is determined by the hydrogel shell.


Most of the work discussed in this review involves microgels based on N-isopropylacrylamide. However, related monomers also yield polymers which have a lower critical solution temperature in water and a few of these monomers have been used wx  to make temperature-sensitive hydrogels.
