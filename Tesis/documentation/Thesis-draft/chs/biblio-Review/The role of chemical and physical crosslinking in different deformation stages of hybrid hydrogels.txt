  abstract = {Hybrid crosslinking hydrogels have exhibited excellent mechanical properties, however, the relationship between chemical and physical crosslinking in the various deformation stages is still indistinct. Here, a hybrid hydrogel was explored by inducing low density of chemical crosslinking into latex particle hydrogels (LP-Gel), in which latex particles act as physical crosslinking centers for inducing efficient aggregation of hydrophobic chains. The resulting hybrid hydrogel exhibited extraordinary mechanical performance. It is found that the role of chemical and physical crosslinking was different during different deformation levels. The synergistic effects of chemical and physical crosslinking allow hydrogels to dissipate a large number of energy, significantly enhancing the mechanical strength of hydrogels. Moreover, the hybrid hydrogel exhibited puncture resistant, excellent ductility and rapid recovery.},

Hybrid crosslinking hydrogels consist of covalent and noncovalent crosslinking.
The dynamic physical crosslinking could effectively dissipate energy via destruction and reorganization, and the chemical crosslinking could sustain skeleton construction.

H-Gel exhibited an identical curve with P-Gel, much higher than C-Gel.
