# In Silico Synthesis of Microgel Particles

Soft colloids, combining properties of hard-sphere colloids and polymers, offer the interesting possibility to tailor their macroscopic behavior and flow at the molecular level.1


Since the single-particle elasticity alters the properties of the resulting macroscopic material, establishing the crucial link between microscopic properties and macroscopic response requires the knowledge of the effective interactions among particles.
