  abstract = {As soft aqueous hydrogels have moved from new materials to the basis for real engineered devices in the last 20~years, their surface friction and lubrication are emerging as critical aspects of their function. The flexibility to alter and augment their mechanical and surface properties through control of the crosslinked 3D polymer networks has produced materials with diverse surface behaviors, even with the relatively simple composition of a single monomer and crosslink chemistry. Correspondingly with new understandings of the bulk behavior of hydrogels has been the identification of the mechanisms that govern the lubricity and frictional response under dynamic sliding conditions. Here we review these efforts, closely examining and identifying the internal and external influences that drive tribological response in high water content crosslinked hydrogels. The roles of surface structure, elasticity, contact response, charge, water interaction and water flow are addressed here as well as current synthesis and testing methods. We also collect open questions as well as the future needs to fully understand and exploit the surface properties of hydrogels for sliding performance.},

Tunable soft and aqueous gels, also known as hydrogels, are one of the leading soft matter surrogates for active matter; 
they are engineered for both temporary and permanent medical prostheses such as catheter coatings, soft contact lenses, and valves [1]. 

Many of these devices interact directly with dynamic biological interfaces, fully integrated with metabolism, immune response, and other functions, all the while experiencing the mechanical environment of complex sliding speeds, bearing forces, and contact durations. 

Controlling the motions of slip, that is, the friction and lubrication, is critical to proper function. 
Crosslinked hydrogels are often thought to be inherently lubricious, but in fact there is a broad spectrum of friction and lubricating abilities. 

The lubrication of hydrogels was first described by lubricated sliding of engineering materials in that there are regimes of fluid-controlled lubrication and material-controlled lubrication that loosely resemble hydrodynamic and boundary friction, but the similarities past that are scant. 
Launched in part by seminal work by JP Gong summarized in a 2006 review of hydrogel lubrication [2], the field of hydrogel friction and lubrication has expanded quickly, with over 200 archival articles published since then under the topic of “hydrogel lubrication” as reported by Web of Science [3]. 

Efforts over the past ~ 20 years have sought to identify the ways in which the unique properties of hydrogels control their sliding behavior, which has subsequently required the development of new experimental techniques and data interpretation. 

The aim of this review is to present a summary of the most important considerations for hydrogel lubrication, including the mechanics of hydrogel materials, mechanisms of friction and lubrication, updated testing techniques, water-network interactions and flow, and surface structures and designs. 
A thorough understanding of the origins of hydrogel lubrication and friction will allow for their surfaces to be engineered for applications of the future.


# Models of elasticity fro sinle and multi-network hydrogels

For solid materials, mechanical behavior is traditionally defined by the constitutive stress–strain relations expressing stress as a function of strain and strain rate [4]. 

For many isotropic engineering materials, the response is characterized as initially being linear-elastic: that is stress rising proportionally with strain, up to a limit where after the material either fractures or begins to plastically deform. 
When deformations and strains are small in the proportional limit the response may be approximated by the three-dimensional tensor  also known as Hooke’s law. 
Here, the expression for the stress tensor (σ) is related to the shear modulus (G) of the material, the applied strain (E), the Kronecker delta function (δ), and Lame first parameter (λ) of the material. 

Hydrogels, conversely, have high and non-linear strains before failure, which is also typical in hyper-elastic elastomers [5, 6]. 
In their fully swollen and hydrated form, hydrogels can withstand extremely large compressive and tensile strains with little to no permanent distortion prior to failure [7–9]. 

Polyacrylamide samples (86% water content), for example, during tensile experiments reached strains up to 1200% before failure [10]. 

Two unique properties of hydrogels appear to dominate their response to strains: 
    (1) water content governs the elastic response in the linear-elastic regime (typically strains ≪ 40%), and 
    (2) crosslink density/network characteristics determine fracture toughness [9]. 

Several models have been used in an attempt to recapitulate the complex responses observed in these biological and bio-inspired materials and include the Mooney-Rivlin model, the NeoHookean Model, and the Ogden model [11–14]. 
Each model has its limitations, as most were not specifically developed to handle a hydration-dependent, multi-network material. 
However, experimental and computational validation has found case-specific solutions and applicable strain ranges for hydrogels [15–17]. 

## Contact mechanisms
Contact mechanics measurements, critical to evaluating the tribological performance of a hydrogel, performed in the linear-elastic range suggest that bulk hydrogel response to compressive loads is dependent upon the osmotic pressure of the hydrogel and is consistent with Hertzian predictions over several timescales [18, 19]. 
Additional measurements showed that this was geometry dependent, suitable for solid (or thick) samples that lack sharp edges [20, 21]. 
For example, by changing a solid hydrogel indenting probe to a thin-walled design the mechanical response (contact area to force) became nearly linear, and by indenting a hydrogel with a conic punch locally exceeded the osmotic pressure of the gel allowing fluid flow. 

While strains are traditionally high at failure for hydrogels [6, 7, 22–24] stresses are typically very low (on the order of kilopascals); this remains one of the major hurdles in more robust applications of hydrogels in medicine [1]. 

## About enhancing the hydrogels mechanical response
A potential solution is to supplement the original hydrogel with another material that enhances its properties. 
Multi-network hydrogels containing a brittle, strong component synthesized to increase strength along with a typical softer, weaker hydrogel constituent that maintains other advantageous qualities such as low coefficient of friction, is one of the primary ways to address this concern [25–31]. 
Another emerging method is to synthesize nanocomposite hydrogels that use physically confined particles in the gel to modify the overall mechanical properties [32–35]. 
The strategy is derived from tribological particulate additives to PTFE to reduce wear rates [36]. 

The goal of both methods is to open the possibilities for new types of soft scaffolding in biological applications and  medicine [28]. 
The incorporation of these complex hydrogels as tribological testing materials could expand the ranges of stresses and deformations simultaneously measured to achieve diverse biologically relevant test conditions. 
The composition of multi-network and nanocomposite hydrogels is rich with variation in mechanical responses and may vary strongly between networks composed of similar materials, but dissimilar in synthesis techniques and concentrations. 
Because of the possibility of designing hydrogels with such a wide array of mechanical properties, the hyper-elastic models must be validated on a case-by-case basis [8, 33].
