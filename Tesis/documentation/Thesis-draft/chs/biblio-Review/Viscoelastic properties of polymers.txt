# Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers




# The Nature of Viscoelastic Behaviour


{Introduction}
Classical theory of elasticity (Hooke's law) states that the stress is directly proportional to strain in small deformations and independent of the rate of strain.
In classical theory of hydrodynamics (in accordance with Newton's law) the stress is alwas directly proportional to rate of strain and independent of the strain.

For inifnitesimal strains and rates of strain, this models can predict experimental results.
For strains and rates of strain that do not fall into that condition, deviations are observed.
It is commonly observe the following two deviations: 

{First typo of deviation: Finite}
when finite strains are imposed on solids that are soft enough to be deformed substantially without breaking, the stres-strain relation are much more complacated.
In steady flow finite strain rates, such as polymeric solutions and undiluted uncrosslinked polymers exhibit marked deviations.

[Note: Dividing infinitesimal and finite depends on the level of precision under consideration and it varies greatly from one material to another.]


{Second type: }
In the inifinitesimal regime of strain and rate of strain, a system may exhibit behaviour which combines liquidlike and solidlike characteristics.
(Not quite solid)
- A body that is not quite solid does not maintain a constant deformation under constant stress, but goes on slowly deformaing with time, or creeps.
- Whean such body is constrained at constant deformaiton, the stress reuired to hold it diminishes gradually or relaxes
(Not quite liquid ? viscoelastic)
- A body which is not quite liquid, while flowing under constant stress, store some of the energy input, instead of dissipating it all as heat
- it may recover part of its deformation when the stress is removed, that is elastic recoil.
    - When such bodies are subjectd to sinusoidally oscillating stress, the strain is neither exctly in phase with the stress (as it would be for a perfectly elastic solid) nor out of phase (as it would be for a perfectly viscous liquid) but somewhere in between.
- Some of the energy input is stored and recovered in each cycle and some is dissipated as heat.
Materials whose behaviour exhibits such characteristics are called Viscoelastic.

{How it is represented a linear viscoelastic material?}
If both strain and rate of strain are inifinitesimal, and the time-depedent stress-strain realtions can be described by linear differential equations with constant coefficient, we have linear viscoelastic behaviour, then, in a given experiment the ratio of the stress to strain is a function of time alone, and not the stress magnitud.


{About constitutive equations}
Are relastions between stress, strain and their time dependences

If strains and/or rates of strain are finite, the constitutive equation may be quite complicated.
If ther are inifinitesimal corresponding to linear viscoelastic behaviour, the eqn is relatively simple

{About the theory of linear viscoelasticity}
The foundations of the phenomenological theory of linear viscoelasticity were inspired by creep and relaxation experiments on fibers of metal and glas and the dissipation of energy in sinusoidally oscillating deformations.
Linear viscoelasticity has provided valuable information about the structure of metals, the deviations from perfect elasticity here are small.

{Viscoelaticity in polymeric systems}
In polymeric systems, mechanical behaviour is dominated by viscoelastic phenomena.

The viscoelasticity in polymers is not unexpected when one considers the complicated molecular adjusments.

In deformation of a hard solid, atoms are displaced from equilibrium positions in fields of force which are quite local in character.
Other mechanical phenomena reflect structural imperfections involving distances discontinuously larger than atomic dimensions.

In an ordinary liquid composed of small molecules, viscous flow reflects the change in time under stress of the distribution of molecules surrounding a given molecule 
    + the relevant forces adn processes of readjustment are quite lcal in character 

In a polymer, each flexible threadlike molecule pervades an average volume much grater than atomic dimensions and is continually changing the shape of its contour as it wriggles and writhes with its thermal energy.

To characterize the various configurations or contour shapes which it assumes, it is necessary to consider grss long range contour relationships, somewhat more local relationships seen with a moder detailed scale, and so on, eventually including the orientation of bonds in the chain backbone with respecto to each other on a scale of atomic dimensions, .

...

Re-arrangements on a local scale are relatively rapid, on a long-range scale very slow.
Under stress, a new assorment of configurations is obtained; the response to th local aspect of the new distribution is rapid, the response to the long-range aspects is slow, and all told there is a very wide and continuous range of time scale covering the response of such a system to external stress.


Every amorphous polymeric system has a glass transition temperature below which the writhing thermal motions essentially cease.
Long-range convolutional re-adjustments are severly restricted; there is still a wide range of response states to external stress, but different in nature.


(transistion paragraph)
From measurements of viscoelastic properties of polymers, information can be obtained about the nature and the rates of the configurational rearrangements, and the disposition and interaction of the macromolecules in both their short-range and their long-range interrelations. 

From the standpoint of the physical chemist, this provides a field of inquiry with unique features of interest. 
Investigation of viscoelastic properties of polymers has also been greatly stimulated, of course, by the practical importance of mechanical behavior in the processing and utilization of rubbers, plastics, and fibers. 
As a result, a very high propertion of all studies on viscoelasticity in the past four decades has been devoted to the viscoelasticity of polymers.
