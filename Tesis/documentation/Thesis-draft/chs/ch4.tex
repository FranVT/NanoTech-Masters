\chapter{Conclusion}

We conclude that we have a conclusion in two years.

The patchy particle protocol is a vlid methodology to simulate the mechanical response of polymeric networks.

In order to simulate hydrogels we need no add a FENE potential.

The reverible interactions are more sutiable to model microgel particle response.
