\chapter{Conclusion}

We conclude that we have a conclusion in two years.

The patchy particle protocol is a vlid methodology to simulate the mechanical response of polymeric networks.

In order to simulate hydrogels we need no add a FENE potential.

The reverible interactions are more sutiable to model microgel particle response.

For future works we can \dots analyze the following important topological measures associated with the entanglement network: the primitive path countour length, the number of entanglements per chain, the end-to-end length of an entanglement strand and the number of central particles per entanglement strand.
