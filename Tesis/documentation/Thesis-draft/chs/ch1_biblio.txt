  abstract = {Polymer networks, which are materials composed of many smaller components---referred to as ``junctions'' and ``strands''---connected together via covalent or non-covalent/supramolecular interactions, are arguably the most versatile, widely studied, broadly used, and important materials known. From the first commercial polymers through the plastics revolution of the 20th century to today, there are almost no aspects of modern life that are not impacted by polymer networks.

[This goes into the gels subsection]

From a structural perspective, polymer networks are composed of network “junctions” (in some cases, these can also be referred to as “crosslinks”, defined as a bond that links one strand to another), which have three or more groups (the exact “branch functionality” we refer to as f) emanating from a core, connected together by f “strands.” 

Strands can be linear polymer chains, flexible short molecules, rigid struts/ linkers, etc.

junctions and strands in polymer networks can be linked together via physical interactions (e.g., van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, Coulombic interactions, metalligand coordination) or covalent bonds. 
Hence, polymer networks are conventionally classified as “physical” (supramolecular) or “chemical” (covalent) networks. 
It should be noted that this classification does not always accurately reflect material properties; bond strengths and exchange rates are much more informative. 
For example, given sufficiently strong and static physical interactions, physical networks can behave identically to chemical networks; alternatively, the incorporation of mechanisms for covalent bond exchange can result in chemical networks that exhibit adaptable mechanical properties regulated by external stimuli. 
Thus, the properties of polymer networks can vary widely depending on the composition of the junctions and strands as well as the formation and use conditions. 
With this broad view in mind, nearly all polymer networks, regardless of their colloquial name, structure, properties, etc. can generally be divided into one of four major classes: thermosets, thermoplastics, elastomers, and gels.


### Thermosets
are polymer networks where the junctions and strands are typically connected via covalent bonds and where the material is used at a temperature well below the glass transition temperature.
They are rigid materials (Young s moduli of 109 Pa) that are normally insoluble in all solvents and not processable once formed (unless a mechanism for junction/strand exchange is available, such as in covalent adaptable networks/vitrimers).
Classical thermosets typically degrade rather than become fluid upon heating.
Some examples of commercially important thermosets include formaldehyde resins, polyurethanes, and epoxy resins.


### Thermoplastics
are networks of macromolecules connected together via non-covalent (supramolecular) interactions, where the material is used well below its glass transition temperature. 
Above a certain temperature, thermoplastics can transition from rigid solids to processable viscoelastic fluids that can, at least in principle, be remolded, healed, and recycled. 
We note that thermoplastics are conventionally considered as “non-crosslinked” due to the lack of covalent bonding between macromolecular chains; at their operating temperatures, however, the strength of the intermolecular non-covalent interactions within many thermoplastics is very high, resulting in mechanical properties similar to their thermosetting counterparts and justifying their classification as “polymer networks.” 
Examples of thermoplastics are polyethylene and polypropylene plastics, poly(methyl methacrylate) acrylics, polycarbonates, and polyamides (e.g., Nylon).

### Elastomers
are polymer networks that are used at temperatures above their glass transition temperature. 
They are typically composed of covalently bonded macromolecules, though they can also be constructed from non-covalent interactions (the latter are referred to as “thermoplastic elastomers”). 
As a result, they are soft but non-fluid materials (Young s moduli of 106 Pa or lower) that can be reversibly stretched to high extensions without breaking. 
Examples of elastomers include vulcanized natural rubber, silicone rubbers, and EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) rubber.

### Gels
are polymer networks constructed from either covalent or supramolecular bonds that are swollen in liquid media such as water or organic solvents. 
The network structure ensures that the liquid is held within the material. 
Gels are usually very soft (Young s moduli of 103–104 Pa) but are often capable of undergoing relatively large deformation.
Examples of gels include gelatin, fibrin, and polyacrylamide hydrogel.


# Mechanisms for polymer network formation

There are three major mechanisms used for polymer network synthesis: 
    addition/chain-growth polymerization, 
    step-growth polymerization, and 
    vulcanization.

### Addition/chain-growth polymerization 
occurs by a chain reaction wherein one monomer (typically an unsaturated compound, e.g., an olefin) at a time adds onto the end of growing polymer strands. 
In the presence of multifunctional monomers (“crosslinkers,” e.g., divinylbenzene in the case of radical polymerization) that serve as junctions, two or more propagating polymer chains can be linked together (“crosslinked”), inducing the formation of a polymer network.


### Step-growth polymerization
starts from multifunctional monomers that are capable of reacting with each other to form dimers, then oligomers, and eventually polymers. 
If one or more of the monomers have a functionality (f) greater than two, branched polymers are formed; further reactions between these branched polymers can lead to polymer network formation. 
One common strategy for forming polymer networks through a step-growth process is referred to as “end-linking,” where the chain ends of bifunctional molecules (referred to as “A2”) are linked by multi-functional monomers (referred to as “Bf”) in a reaction between functional groups A and B.


### Vulcanization
is a special case wherein preformed polymers are crosslinked by forming bonds between functional groups present on the polymer backbone or sidechains. 
A well-known example is sulfur vulcanization of natural rubber, where the alkene groups of polyisoprene strands are crosslinked by reaction with sulfur. 
Notably, vulcanization can also be viewed as a step-growth polymerization wherein the preformed polymer (e.g., polyisoprene) serves as a multifunctional (e.g., Bf) component.[10]


----------

## Gel point

For any polymer network forming process, there is a critical point known as the “gel point,” where the reaction phase transitions from liquid to solid. 
Since many properties of polymer networks change abruptly at the gel point and are only useful beyond the gel point, several theoretical models have been developed to predict the gel point for various network formation processes, such as mean-field theory,[11,12] critical percolation theory,[12,13] and the kinetic gelation model.[14] 
Here, we introduce two classical approaches—the Carothers model[15] and the Flory–Stockmayer model[11,16]to predicting the relationship between gelation and the extent of reaction in step-growth polymerization.

### Carothers model
that gelation occurs when the number-average molar mass of the macromolecules in a network forming process approaches infinity. 
In a step-growth polymerization containing equivalent numbers of A and B groups, Carothers derived that the critical extent of reaction pc at the gel point is given by [Eq. (1)]:

### Flory-Stockmayer
derived an expression for predicting pc (critical extente of reaction) by calculating the point at which the weight average molar mass approaches infinity, or Mw ! 1. 
The Flory–Stockmayer model is a mean-field approach, where network formation is modeled as percolation on a Bethe lattice. 
For a step-growth polymerization involving A and B groups, they postulated that [Eq. (2)]:

# Polymer Network Structure

Chemical and topological structure together dictate the properties of polymer networks. 
The chemical structure is described by the chemical composition of network components; as we will discuss later in the review, tuning chemical composition is an effective approach to imparting functions to polymer networks.
Polymer network topology delineates how the junctions and strands of a polymer network are connected.
Given that many properties (e.g., elasticity, porosity, and swellability) of polymer networks have topological origins, there is growing interest in understanding and controlling polymer network topology from a molecular perspective.
The vast majority of polymer networks are amorphous or semicrystalline (i.e., featuring amorphous and crystalline domains) and, thus, are rich in topological features that span across several length scales, ranging from the molecular ( angstrom) to submicron scale.

### 10-100 nm
From 10–100 nm, polymer network topology is characterized by inhomogeneity in junction/strand density (Figure 1), which results from concentration fluctuations during network formation.[20]
Small-angle scattering techniques provide semi-quantitative information at this length scale (see below).[21,22]

### 1-10 nm
Dangling/unreacted strands and/or junctions, entanglements, and loops of various orders comprise the macromolecular features that dominate network structure on the length scale ranging from 1–10 nm (Figure 1). 

Dangling functionalities, often referred to as “dangling chains,” occur when a reactive group from the network precursors remains unreacted after network formation. 

Loops are cyclic structures defined by the number of strands and junctions that comprise the cycle. 
Primary loops, the simplest cyclic topologies, form when both ends of one strand are attached to the same junction. 
A secondary loop is formed from two strands connected to the same two junctions. 
Although they contain rich topological information, conventional scattering and spectroscopic methods fail to characterize these macromolecular features.[23]

### <1 nm 
At the molecular level, network features are primarily dictated by chemistry rather than topology; branch functionality, however, is a critical molecular-scale feature that dictates network topology (Figure 1). 
While branch functionality is difficult to characterize experimentally, it can typically be predicted based on the functionality of network precursors.

To characterize the often chemically indistinguishable (macro)molecular-level topological features in amorphous regions of polymer networks (e.g., unreacted functionalities, loops of various orders), theory/ simulation, swelling experiments, and mechanical tests are often used.

## Structual Control of Polymer Networks
As discussed above, polymer networks can be crystalline, amorphous, or both (semicrystalline). 
Many thermoplastics (e.g., Nylon, Kevlar, linear polyethylene, syndiotactic polystyrene) are semicrystalline or crystalline when processed using slow quenching or uniaxial stretching—conditions that maximize the reversibility of intermolecular interactions (e.g., van der Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions) and facilitate packing of polymer strands.[52] 
As described in Section 5.2.2, the use of reversible bond formation between conformationally rigid monomers has recently enabled the synthesis of crystalline polymer networks, where the spatial distribution of junctions exhibits long-range order. 
A common strategy to control the structure of all types of polymer networks incorporates network precursors with preexisting topological features such as a defined branch functionality and/or a unique molecular architecture. 
Recently, methods that bias polymerization kinetics, such as semibatch monomer addition[32] and templated synthesis,[49] have also been used to manipulate polymer network topology.

### Controlling Branch Funcitonality of Polymer Networks

Branch functionality (f) is a theoretical value that describes the number of elastically effective strands connected to a network junction; it is equal to the monomer functionality when there are no unreacted functionalities or loops. 
In practice, the number of elastically effective strands connected to a junction (effective branch functionality, feff) could be greatly reduced by the presence of topological defects.


In end-linked networks, the branch functionality can be controlled by changing the functionality of the network precursors

Self-assembly is often used for the construction of high f polymer networks.



### Controlling Polymer-Networks Strand Topology

Many topologically intriguing macromolecular architectures have been realized through the development of advanced synthetic strategies and methods.[68,69] 
Leveraging these techniques, polymer networks with topologically unique motifs, such as 
    cyclic polymers,[70] 
    polyrotaxanes,[71] and 
    polycatenanes,[72] have been reported.


### Controlling Loops of Various Orders in Polymers Networks
Most polymer networks are rich in elastically defective topological structures such as unreacted functionalities and loops of various orders. 
Unreacted functionalities can be controlled by altering the reaction stoichiometry or through the deliberate doping of monofunctional network precursors.[89]
In contrast, controlling loops in amorphous polymer networks is much more challenging.



### Controlled Radical Polymerization in Polymer Network

Radical polymerization involves four elementary processes: 
    initiation, 
    propagation, 
    chain transfer, and 
    termination.
Conventional free radical polymerization suffers from a slow rate of initiation relative to propagation as well as unavoidable termination, together leading to limited control over chain length/topology. 
In contrast, the concepts of reversible termination and degenerative chain transfer[95,96] enabled the development of modern reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) techniques that provide convenient access to polymers with predetermined molecular weights and well-defined microstructures.[97]

Three major RDRP techniques are most commonly used for polymer network synthesis: 
    nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP),[98–100] 
    atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP),[53,101–103] and 
    reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.[104–106]



### Topology-Switchable Networks

The critical role that topology plays in dictating the properties of materials has inspired a class of polymer networks that can interconvert between two different stable topological states.

In this system, the network junctions switch from Pd3L6 (f = 6) to Pd24L48 (f = 48) upon irradiation with ultraviolet light and back with green light (Figure 6 A).[51]

Large changes in the storage modulus are possible upon topology switching; 
    perhaps more interestingly, the different ligand exchange dynamics of the two MOCs are reflected in an order of magnitude difference in the characteristic stress-relaxation times of their corresponding networks, enabling the material to be switched repeatedly between a soft and self-healing state and a stiff, dimensionallystable state. 
For further discussion on the ramifications of network structure/topology on mechanical behaviors, see Section 4 below.

# Basics Properties of Polymer Networks

## Elasticity


The physical origin of rubber elasticity comes from the loss in conformational entropy that occurs as a strand in a network is stretched; this process is commonly depicted as the unwinding of flexible, random coils. 
Once the external stretching force is removed, an elastic entropic force restores the strands to their unstretched and higher entropy state. 
As a result, network strands can be considered as entropic molecular springs. 

In this section, we introduce the two simplest theories that capture the entropic origin of rubber elasticity for nonentangled polymer networks at the molecular-level: the affine and phantom network models.

### Affine network model

assumes that the relative deformation experienced by each network strand is the same as the macroscopic deformation applied to the entire network. 
When network strands are treated as Gaussian chains and the polymer network is assumed to be incompressible (i.e., Poisson s ratio is 0.5), the stress-deformation behavior of an affine network in response to a uniaxial force is expressed as [Eq. (8)]:

\sigma = \upsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}RT(\lambda-\frac{1}{\lambda^2})

- \sigma is the engineering stress, defined as the applied force divided by the initial cross-sectional area of the material; 
- l is the ratio of the final length to the initial length of the material along the direction of the applied force (Note: when describing material deformation in a tensile test, engineering strain e is sometimes used in place of l. e is defined as the ratio of the total deformation to the initial length of the material along the direction of the applied force. Hence, e 1⁄4 l @ 1); 
- neff is the density of elastically effective strands;
- R is the gas constant; and 
- T is the temperature. 

The shear modulus G, correlates with the Young's modulus E, can be calculate from Eqn 9, where (\upsilon is Poisson's ratio)

G = E/(2(1+\upsilon)) = \upsilon_{eff}RT

### Phantom network

assumes that network junctions can fluctuate around their average positions. 
These fluctuations reduce the conformational restrictions experienced by strands, which, in turn, lowers the net free energy of the system relative to the affine network. 

In the phantom model, the shortest-path tree of network strands connecting each junction to the network surface is simplified as an effective chain that captures the cumulative behavior of the network. 
This simplification, which takes into consideration the network branch functionality f, leads to an expression for the phantom network modulus [Eq. (10)]:[12]

G = \upsilon_{eff}RT(1-2/f)

As a result, the predicted shear modulus in the phantom network model is lower than that of the affine network model.
The engineering stress for the uniaxial deformation of a phantom network remains the same [Eq. (11)].

## Swelling of Polymer Networks
\sigma = G(\lambda-1/\lambda^2)

- E is often determined from the initial slope of the stressstrain curve under tensile force (Figure 7 A), which is measured using a tensile testing instrument (e.g., Instron).
- On the other hand, G is typically determined from oscillatory shear rheology (Section 4.3). 
    These methods provide seemingly simple opportunities to experimentally evaluate the affine and phantom models.

This approach is complicated, however, by the presence of elastically defective structures in real polymer networks, which preclude an accurate determination of neff.

|-
Johnson, Olsen, and co-workers developed real elastic network theory (RENT), a modified phantom network model that incorporates the effect of loops of various orders to predict network elasticity.[123,124] Using accurately determined neff based on primary loop characterization data obtained through NDS and simulations, RENT precisely predicted the shear elastic moduli G of gels with f = 3 or 4 (Figure 7 B). It should be noted that in the original RENT, the predicted impact of larger loops (i.e., loops of order three or above) on network elasticity was approximated. Recently, Lang proposed an equivalent resistance method to exactly solve for the impact of finite loops on elasticity.[125] Inspired by this approach, Olsen and co-workers modified RENT and found that under classical assumptions of phantom network theory, loops with order thre

As noted above, the affine and phantom network models assume no strand entanglements. 

In polymer networks made of long linear polymers, entanglements effectively serve as additional supramolecular crosslinks to increase the network modulus and toughness. 
Stress-deformation behaviors of entangled elastomers can be phenomenologically fitted using the Mooney-Rivlin model to empirically obtain the contribution of entanglements towards elasticity.[12,29] 
Recently, Matyjaszewski, Sheiko, and co-workers demonstrated the severe reduction of trapped entanglements in elastomers made of densely grafted bottlebrush polymers.[120,129,130] 
In these solvent-free polymer networks, the network strands (bottlebrush backbones) are effectively swollen by the low Tg bottlebrush sidechains, leading to low moduli comparable to conventional solvent-containing gels.
These materials demonstrate stress-strain behaviors resembling a variety of biological tissues[131] and hold great promise for biomaterial applications.[132]


## Swelling of Polymers Networks

Polymer networks constructed from strong (e.g., covalent) bonds typically do not dissolve in solvents. 
Instead, such networks absorb solvent up to an equilibrium concentration and undergo a concomitant increase in volume. 

The equilibrium degree of swelling is dictated by a balance between the free energy of polymer-solvent mixing and the free energy cost of expanding the network, which is expressed by the Flory–Rehner equation[11,133] for isotropic swelling of an affine polymer network [Eq. (12)]:

\ln(1-\phi_{eq}) + \phi_eq + \xi\phi^2_{eq} = \eta_{eff}V_1(\phi_eq/2-\phi^{1/3}_{eq})

where 
- feq is the volume fraction of the polymer network in the equilibrium swollen state, 
- c is the Flory–Huggins polymer-solvent interaction parameter, 
- neff is the density of elastically effective strands in the unswollen network, and 
- V1 is the molar volume of the solvent.

The simple ability to control the swelling of polymer networks has recently enabled exciting new applications of these materials. 
For example, fixing/crosslinking biological tissues onto hydrogels has been exploited to obtain highresolution optical microscopy images in a technique referred to as CLARITY.[139]

## Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks

Polymeric materials exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics upon deformation, meaning that their properties may vary with the time scale or frequency at which measurements are performed. 
To characterize this viscoelasticity with respect to tensile, compressive, or shear deformation, several types of experimental measurements are commonly applied, such as stress relaxation, creep, and oscillatory shear tests. 
In this section, we will focus on oscillatory shear rheology of polymer networks. 
We refer the reader to additional literature for a comprehensive understanding of polymer viscoelasticity.[12,147,148]



Oscillatory shear measurements are often performed on dynamic mechanical analyzers or rheometers, where a sample is subjected to a sinusoidal shear strain g(t) with small amplitude g0 and angular frequency w [Eq. (13)]:
\gamma(t) = \gamma_o\sin(\omega t)

The linear response of a viscoelastic material in terms of stress s(t) is sinusoidal with the same frequency w, but leads the strain by a phase angle d [Eq. (14)]:  
\sigma(t)=\sigma_o\sin(\omega t+\delta)

The stress can be separated into two components that oscillate with the same frequency w, one in phase with the strain and the other out of phase with the strain by p/2 [Eq. (15)]:  
\sigma(t) = \gamma_o[G'(\omega)\sin(\omega t) + G''(\omega)\cos(\omega t)]

Equation (15) defines the storage modulus G’(w) and the loss modulus G’’(w), the former of which describes the elastic response of the material while the latter describes the viscous response. 
At a given frequency w, if G’(w) > G’’(w), the material response is considered to be solid-like; if G’(w) < G’’(w), the material is considered to exhibit fluid-like behavior.

Oscillatory shear rheology can be applied to monitor network formation. 
Figure 8 C shows the evolution of storage moduli and loss moduli at three frequencies during the chemical crosslinking of polybutadiene.[152] 
As the crosslinking proceeds, the sample transitions from a viscous solution to an elastic solid, resulting in a change in viscoelasticity from G’(w) < G’’(w) to G’(w) > G’’(w). 
The crossover point at which G’(w) = G’’(w) is commonly used to define the gel point.[153]

Oscillatory shear measurements can also be performed at variable temperatures to study the temperature dependence of material properties. 
This technique is especially useful for polymer networks containing dynamic bonds that are sensitive to temperature. 
Figure 8 D shows the storage and loss moduli (measured at 1 rad s@1) as a function of temperature for an aqueous solution of a triblock copolymer ABA, where the terminal A blocks are thermoresponsive PNIPAm and the middle block B is hydrophilic poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA).[154] 
Above the LCST of PNIPAm, the terminal A blocks transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, inducing the formation of multicompartment hydrogels. 
Gelation was evidenced by a change of material properties from G’(w) < G’’(w) to G’(w) > G’’(w) around 45 8C.

Entanglements in linear polymers, which can be viewed as dynamic mechanically interlocked bonds, can be experimentally observed through analysis of the modulus as a function of either temperature or time (Figure 8 E). 
In the classical case of amorphous, entangled polymers that lack covalent crosslinks, at temperatures below Tg a high Young s modulus is observed. 
At intermediate temperatures above Tg, the modulus decreases, but does not drop to near zero, which occurs for non-entangled polymers. 
This regime is referred to as the “rubbery plateau”; it represents a temperature or time regime wherein strand entanglements provide transient network junctions (mechanical crosslinks) that are elastically effective. 
At even higher temperatures or longer times, the modulus drops precipitously, and the material behaves as a liquid.
