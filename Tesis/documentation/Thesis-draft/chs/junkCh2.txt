the formation of covalent bonds between polymer chains is a significant phenomenon.

This process is achieved by polymerization and reactions induced by cross-linking agents.

Chain-growth polymerization includes free radical polymerization, controlled free radical polymerization, anionic and cationic polymerization.

Gamma and electron beam polymerization involves high energy electromagnetic irradiation as crosslinker. 
These high energy radiations can crosslink water-soluble monomer or polymer chain ends without the addition of a crosslinker.

\paragraph{Reinforce the idea that is better irreversible and reversible than covalent vs non-covalent}
\citep{picchioniHydrogelsBasedDynamic2018}
The same concept of covalent reversible bonds can be used for the hydrogel formation and disruption. 
Examples of interactions used in this case are (Figure 2) electrostatic ones [19,20], cycloadditions [8,21], redox reactions [22–24], and other ones such as imine [25–28] and enamine formation [29], acylhydrazone [30–33], and borax acid reaction with hydroxyls [13,34–36].

The molecular reversibility can be achieved in two different ways: either by utilizing equilibrium reactions (e.g., the Diels-Alder reaction) or through dynamic exchange reactions (e.g., the reaction of an excess amino group with an epoxide group)\citep{picchioniHydrogelsBasedDynamic2018}.

The incorporation of crosslinkers results in an increase in the molecular weight of the polymer chains, thereby limiting their translational movement and decreasing their solubility, and augment the interactions between the polymer chains\citep{priyaComprehensiveReviewHydrogel2024}.

The cohesion forces that allow the cross-linking of the polymer have a covalent character, and other forces such as electrostatic, hydrophobic, dipole–dipole interactions, or hydrogen bonds intervene [11–13]\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.

Similarly, hydrophilic polymers can be cross-linked through chemical bonds, leading to the formation of hydrogels, which are materials that have attracted particular attention in the biomedical field [17]\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.

Moreover, since the hydrogel has covalent crosslinking, it can return to its original state after unloading\citep{xuRoleChemicalPhysical2018}.

It was also found that the energy dissipation of HGel with a low chemical crosslinking density was dependent on the hydrophobic interaction at the initial deformation stage\citep{xuRoleChemicalPhysical2018}\footnote{Pascals has the same units as the ``dissipation'' energy, ``dissipation'' energy is the area under the loading and unloading curves.}.
Molecular chains between two chemical crosslinking points were crimped and curled, and therefore the physical crosslinking would play a major role for energy dissipation.

As a result, we can conclude that at initial deformation state the physical crosslinking would play the major role of energy dissipation, whereas the chemical and physical crosslinking would work synergistically in large deformation dissipated more energy to enhance mechanical strength of HGel\citep{xuRoleChemicalPhysical2018}.
The mechanical property of H-Gel was also affected by the ratio of MBA, AAm, HMA and core-shell LPs\citep{xuRoleChemicalPhysical2018}.

Crystalization 
    (This crystallization process includes crystal nucleation and crystal growth)
Amphiphilic Copolymers 
    (amphiphilic copolymers can aggregate in water to form micelles and hydrogels in which the hydrophobic segments of the polymer self-assembly [40]\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}, Cross-linking is thought to occur by hydrophobic interactions [41])
Hydrogel Cross-linking by charge interactions
    Cross-linking (or de-crosslinking) can be achieved in situ by pH changes that cause ionization or protonation of ionic functional groups and cause gelation\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.
Interaction by Hydrogen Bonds
    Hydrogen bonding interactions can be used to produce hydrogels in vitro by freezethaw cycles. 
Stereo-Complexing
    Stereo-complexing refers to the interactions between polymeric chains, or small molecules, of the same chemical composition but different stereochemistry. 
Protein interaction
    Cross-linking by protein interactions can be accomplished through the use of genetically engineered proteins or antigen–antibody interactions\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.

Graft Copolymerization and Irradiation Crosslinking
    This method allows radiation to act on the polymer matrix, inducing the formation of reactive sites that may interact with a molecule to be grafted, initiating a free radical polymerization process [80].
Reactive function groups
    These are covalent reactions between the functional groups of the polymers (mainly -OH, -COOH, -NH2) that provide solubility to water-soluble polymers [99,100]. 
Enzymatic Method
    Cross-linking of the hydrogel occurs under mild conditions without the need for the use of low molecular weight compounds (monomers, initiators, cross-linking agents), irradiation, or prior polymer functionalization to favor its cross-linking [31,119]. Enzymes often exhibit a high degree of substrate specificity, potentially avoiding side reactions during cross-linking.

A key feature that controls the properties of a polymeric material is its architecture. 
Beyond the conventional linear polymer, architectures such as branched, cyclic, bottlebrush, star and block copolymers have expanded the property profile of polymeric materials and offered opportunities for polymer research and applications.

Conceptually, there are a myriad of ways the mechanical bond can be incorporated into polymer architectures (Fig. 1), and these unique and varied structures can enable property profiles that have never been seen before.

Variations in concentrations, structure, functionality of the monomer, and the cross-linker used in such gels can modify the structure [4]\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.

Since they are systems in an aqueous medium, it is necessary to consider the traditional variables such as temperature, concentration, pH, and ionic strength\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.
Moreover, some hydrogels are capable of responding to external stimuli such as pH, temperature, electricity, light and biological molecules as enzymes during the swelling and shrinking process\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.
Therefore, several studies have made it possible to improve mechanical, optical, or swelling behavior, adding another compound with hydrophobic properties to the hydrophilic monomer\citep{bustamantetorresHydrogelsClassificationAccording2021}.

\paragraph{Transition to talk about printing hydrogels}\citep{correaTranslationalApplicationsHydrogels2021}
Subsequent work developed safer cross-linking mechanisms, which began a trend toward triggering gelation in situ after injection, providing a minimally invasive way of administering  hydrogels to practically any organ or tissue.29,30\footnote{Why the gelation in situ after injection is important?}

Unlike earlier hydrogels that relied on covalent cross-links, some of these hydrogels have self-healing properties and possess mechanical properties akin to native tissue, capable of countering natural forces and stresses of a body in motion.
More recently, shear-thinning hydrogels were developed that are formed through dynamic and reversible cross-linking.34 
For example, physical hydrogels use noncovalent interactions (e.g., supramolecular chemistries) between soluble building blocks in order to self-assemble into a dynamic, reversibly cross-linked  network.35,36 
These “dynamic hydrogels” assembled through reversible cross-links afford the unique property of being injectable even after having formed a gel, due to their shear-thinning and selfhealing behaviors. 
Current research on dynamic hydrogels has revealed novel and useful capabilities that have opened new frontiers for this technology. 

For example, they can stabilize delicate protein and cellular cargoes to combat pharmaceutical  cold-chain limitations,39 they can adhere strongly to tissues to  form protective barriers and bandages,40 and they can be delivered through spray applications to coat complex biological  geometries.41

static covalent cross-links ultimately introduced translational challenges for clinical implementation, since traditional covalent gels require invasive surgical implantation to access nonsuperficial tissues.  
Additionally, new manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing, require dynamic rheological properties during processing, disqualifying the use of traditional covalent  hydrogels.57  
Interest in further developing the translational potential of hydrogels led to innovative methods to implant them through minimally invasive means, of which the most clinically relevant is injection through a needle or catheter (Figure 3).

Hybrid crosslinking hydrogels consist of covalent and noncovalent crosslinking\citep{xuRoleChemicalPhysical2018}. 
The dynamic physical crosslinking could effectively dissipate energy via destruction and reorganization, and the chemical crosslinking could sustain skeleton construction [19,20]\citep{xuRoleChemicalPhysical2018}. 

The molecular reversibility can be actually achieved in two different ways: either by making use of equilibrium reactions (e.g., the Diels-Alder one) or through dynamic exchange reactions (e.g., reaction of an excess amino groups with epoxide ones)\citep{picchioniHydrogelsBasedDynamic2018}.

The general idea is that the use of dynamic covalent bonds allows the polymeric network to adjust itself as a result of an external stimulus\citep{picchioniHydrogelsBasedDynamic2018}. 
This can be achieved in principle through other weaker interactions, e.g., hydrogen bonding\citep{picchioniHydrogelsBasedDynamic2018}. 

the use of covalent bonds displays two distinct and clear advantages [25]. 
In first instance, the network is still covalently linked, which renders it quite robust against small random fluctuations in environmental conditions such as temperature. 
Furthermore, exchange reactions such as the one of an amine with an imine are often kinetically controlled by the use of catalysts. 
In turn, this allows the possibility to freeze the network conformation (by slowing the kinetics) when desired\citep{picchioniHydrogelsBasedDynamic2018}. 
The general concept behind the use of reversible interactions for the hydrogel polymeric chains is the (reversible) network disruption with immediate release of any loading (Figure 3).

Reversible bonds can be incorporated along the backbone (red circles) or at the crosslinking point (green triangles). 
The network, when subjected to an appropriate external stimulus, can then break at the crosslinking point (route A) or along the backbone (route B). 
This generates network fragments that can be quite different in terms of chemical structure even if in both cases the loading (blue circles) will be released. 
As a result of the network disruption, the load is released as the polymeric chains become soluble and not able anymore to entrap the load\citep{picchioniHydrogelsBasedDynamic2018}.
