# Explain from first principles, what is a covalent bond

- Be concise
- Be scientific accurate

A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. This sharing allows each atom to attain a more stable electron configuration, typically resembling that of the nearest noble gas, by filling their outermost electron shells. The bond arises from the quantum mechanical interactions between the atomic orbitals, where the shared electrons occupy a molecular orbital that extends over both atoms, lowering the overall energy and stabilizing the molecule. This bonding mechanism is fundamentally driven by the stabilization that occurs as electrons delocalize between atoms, reducing their kinetic energy compared to being confined to individual atoms.[^1_11][^1_13][^1_18]

# Explain from first principles, what is a physical interaction

- Be concise
- Be scientific accurate

A physical interaction is a fundamental process through which particles or bodies exert forces on each other, resulting in changes in their motion or state without altering their intrinsic nature or chemical identity. These interactions arise from the fundamental forces of nature—gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear—mediated by the exchange of force-carrying particles at the quantum level. Through these forces, energy and momentum are transferred between objects, governing phenomena like attraction, repulsion, collision, and binding without involving chemical transformations.[^2_1][^2_2]

# Explain from first principles, what are functional groups

- Be concise
- Be scientific accurate

Functional groups are specific groups of atoms within molecules that have characteristic structures and chemical behaviors. They determine the physical properties, chemical reactivity, and interactions of the parent molecule. Essentially, functional groups act as the reactive centers in organic molecules, defining how a molecule participates in chemical reactions while the rest of the molecule provides a structural framework.[^3_1][^3_6]
