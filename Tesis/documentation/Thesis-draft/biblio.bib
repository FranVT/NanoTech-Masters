  abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials. Program Summary Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: GPLv2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the St{\o}rmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code. References [1]S.

  DOI={10.1063/1.437577},
  abstractNote={In molecular dynamics, the pressure in a homogeneous system in equilibrium may be calculated by two different methods. The first is based on the virial theorem of Clausius and gives the pressure at the boundary of the system. The second is based on the notion of stress, which is the sum of the appropriate components of the interatomic forces intercepted by an area, and of the components of momentum flux across the area, averaged over the area and over time. We show by means of a detailed comparison of the forces involved that the two methods are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit. In a small system with arbitrary boundary conditions, the neglect of a part of the interactions between the system and the wall results in some error in the pressure calculated by the virial method. In the special case of a system with periodic boundaries, there is no external ’’wall,’’ and the internal pressures calculated by the two methods are the same. However, with comparable effort in computation, the stress method makes more efficient use of the data and yields a result of greater precision than does the virial method. In a system not in equilibrium or not homogeneous, the stress method remains valid but the virial method leads to ambiguous results. These considerations indicate that the method of stress calculation is more general than the virial method.},

    abstract = {Microgels are colloidal-scale particles individually made of cross-linked polymer networks that can swell and deswell in response to external stimuli, such as changes to temperature or pH. Despite a large amount of experimental activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles in silico. We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent (cross-linkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our assembly protocol, we focus on a small microgel test case and show that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated assembly methodologies, e.g., in the case of networks generated from an underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely used fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modeling of microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.},

	abstract = {The elasticity of disordered and polydisperse polymer networks is a fundamental problem of soft matter physics that is still open. Here, we self-assemble polymer networks via simulations of a mixture of bivalent and tri- or tetravalent patchy particles, which result in an exponential strand length distribution analogous to that of experimental randomly cross-linked systems. After assembly, the network connectivity and topology are frozen and the resulting system is characterized. We find that the fractal structure of the network depends on the number density at which the assembly has been carried out, but that systems with the same mean valence and same assembly density have the same structural properties. Moreover, we compute the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement, also known as the (squared) localization length, of the cross-links and of the middle monomers of the strands, showing that the dynamics of long strands is well described by the tube model. Finally, we find a relation connecting these two localization lengths at high density and connect the cross-link localization length to the shear modulus of the system.}

Here I propose a simple trick for performing molecular dynamics simulations of bond-swapping network systems with particle-level description. The method is based on the addition of a computationally non-expensive three-body repulsive potential that encodes for the single-bond per particle condition and establishes a flat potential energy surface for the bond swap.},

  abstract = {Macromolecular structures, such as neuraminidases, hemagglutinins, and monoclonal antibodies, are not rigid entities. Rather, they are characterised by their flexibility, which is the result of the interaction and collective motion of their constituent atoms. This conformational diversity has a significant impact on their physicochemical and biological properties. Among these are their structural stability, the transport of ions through the M2 channel, drug resistance, macromolecular docking, binding energy, and rational epitope design. To assess these properties and to calculate the associated thermodynamical observables, the conformational space must be efficiently sampled and the dynamic of the constituent atoms must be simulated. This paper presents algorithms and techniques that address the abovementioned issues. To this end, a computational review of molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Langevin dynamics, and free energy calculation is presented. The exposition is made from first principles to promote a better understanding of the potentialities, limitations, applications, and interrelations of these computational methods.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, anomalous and nonergodic diffusions are topical issues in almost all disciplines. In 2004, the phrase ``anomalous is normal'' was used in a title of a Physical Review Letters (PRL) paper, which reveals that the diffusion of classical particles on a solid surface has rich anomalous behavior controlled by the friction coefficient, meaning that anomalous diffusion phenomena are ubiquitous in the natural world. This review article first builds the microscopic models (stochastic processes) to describe the experimentally observed phenomena of the motion of the physical/abstract particles under the frameworks of continuous time random walks, Langevin picture, subordinated strong Markov process, etc. Beyond directly conducting statistical analyses on these stochastic processes, we target on delving into these microscopic models to uncover their physical mechanisms and digging out their potential applications. According to the application scenarios and the research requirements, we design the appropriate statistical observables, e.g., the position of the particles, functional of the trajectories of the particles, probability of the first passage time, escape probability, etc. Then, we derive the governing equations of the probability density functions of the statistical observables. We do the mathematical studies on the equations, including well-posedness and regularity analyses, designing numerical schemes, performing numerical analyses, etc. Finally, we present the applications of the models in chemistry and biology, and propose future prospects in this research field.},

Normally, the atomic dynamics are described by classical equations of motion and the effect of the environment is taken into account through the fluctuating and frictional forces. Generally, the nuclear quantum effects and their coupling to other degrees of freedom are difficult to include in an efficient way. This could be a serious limitation on its application to the study of dynamical properties of materials made from light elements, in the presence of external driving electrical or thermal fields. One example of such system is single molecule dynamics on metal surface, an important system that has received intense study in surface science. In this review, we summarize recent effort in extending the Langevin MD to include nuclear quantum effect and their coupling to flowing electrical current. We discuss its applications in the study of adsorbate dynamics on metal surface, current-induced dynamics in molecular junctions, and quantum thermal transport between different reservoirs.},

Here, we address this question by focusing on the archetype of soft colloids: thermoresponsive microgels. These colloidal-sized polymer networks are often assumed to interact through a simple Hertzian potential, a classic model in linear elasticity theory. By developing an appropriate methodology that can be generalized to any kind of soft particle, we are able to calculate all the elastic moduli of nonionic microgels across their volume phase transition (VPT). Remarkably, we reproduce many features seen in experiments, including the appearance of a minimum in the Poisson's ratio close to the VPT. By calculating the particle--particle effective interactions and the resulting collective behavior, we find that the Hertzian model works well up to moderate values of the packing fraction.},

From the first commercial polymers through the plastics revolution of the 20th century to today, there are almost no aspects of modern life that are not impacted by polymer networks. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that must be addressed to enable a complete understanding of these materials and facilitate their development for emerging applications ranging from sustainability and energy harvesting/storage to tissue engineering and additive manufacturing. Here, we provide a unifying overview of the fundamentals of polymer network synthesis, structure, and properties, tying together recent trends in the field that are not always associated with classical polymer networks, such as the advent of crystalline ``framework'' materials. We also highlight recent advances in using molecular design and control of topology to showcase how a deep understanding of structure--property relationships can lead to advanced networks with exceptional properties.},

  abstract = {Hydrogels play a crucial role due to their high-water content and 3D structure, which make them ideal for various applications in biomedicine, sensing, and beyond. They can be prepared from a variety of biomaterials, polymers, and their combinations, allowing for versatility in properties and applications. Hydrogels include natural types derived from collagen, gelatin, alginate, and hyaluronic acid, as well as synthetic types based on polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyacrylamide (PAAm). Each type possesses distinct properties, such as mechanical strength, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, which can be tailored for applications such as wound healing, contact lenses, 3D bioprinting, and tissue engineering. The high-water content of hydrogels mimics natural tissue environments, promoting cell growth and allowing nutrient and waste exchange, which supports the development of functional tissues. They serve as scaffolds in tissue engineering applications, including wound healing, cartilage and bone regeneration, vascular tissue engineering, and organ-on-a-chip systems. Additionally, hydrogels can encapsulate and deliver therapeutic agents, such as growth factors or drugs, to specific target sites in the body. Hydrogels can be prepared through three primary methods: physical crosslinking, which relies on non-covalent interactions such as physical entanglements or hydrogen bonding; chemical crosslinking, which forms covalent bonds between polymer chains to create a stable structure; and irradiation-based crosslinking, where UV irradiation induces rapid hydrogel formation. The choice of crosslinking method depends on the desired properties and applications of the hydrogel. By providing a biomimetic environment, hydrogels facilitate cell growth and differentiation, support tissue formation, and aid in the regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues while delivering therapeutic agents. This review focuses on the critical advancements in processing routes for hydrogel development, summarizing the characterization and application of hydrogels. It also details key applications, including wound healing and cartilage and bone regeneration, as well as the challenges and future perspectives in the field.},

Extensive employment of these products in a number of industrial and environmental areas of application is considered to be of prime importance. As expected, natural hydrogels were gradually replaced by synthetic types due to their higher water absorption capacity, long service life, and wide varieties of raw chemical resources. Literature on this subject was found to be expanding, especially in the scientific areas of research. However, a number of publications and technical reports dealing with hydrogel products from the engineering points of view were examined to overview technological aspects covering this growing multidisciplinary field of research. The primary objective of this article is to review the literature concerning classification of hydrogels on different bases, physical and chemical characteristics of these products, and technical feasibility of their utilization. It also involved technologies adopted for hydrogel production together with process design implications, block diagrams, and optimized conditions of the preparation process.

In a polyrotaxane, the mechanical bond is the result of a linear dumbbell component threaded through a ring, while in a polycatenane, it is the consequence of interlocked ring components. The interlocked nature of these architectures can result in high degrees of conformational freedom and mobility of their components, which can give rise to unique property profiles. In recent years, the synthesis and studies of a range of MIPs has allowed researchers to build an initial understanding of how incorporating mechanical bonds within a polymer structure impacts its material properties. This Review focuses on the understanding of these structure--property relationships with an outlook towards their applications, specifically focusing on four main classes of MIPs: polyrotaxanes, slide-ring gels, daisy-chain polymers and polycatenanes.},

Hydrogels perform functions relevant to a range of biomedical purposes---they can deliver drugs or cells, regenerate hard and soft tissues, adhere to wet tissues, prevent bleeding, provide contrast during imaging, protect tissues or organs during radiotherapy, and improve the biocompatibility of medical implants. These capabilities make hydrogels useful for many distinct and pressing diseases and medical conditions and even for less conventional areas such as environmental engineering. In this review, we cover the major capabilities of hydrogels, with a focus on the novel benefits of injectable hydrogels, and how they relate to translational applications in medicine and the environment. We pay close attention to how the development of contemporary hydrogels requires extensive interdisciplinary collaboration to accomplish highly specific and complex biological tasks that range from cancer immunotherapy to tissue engineering to vaccination. We complement our discussion of preclinical and clinical development of hydrogels with mechanical design considerations needed for scaling injectable hydrogel technologies for clinical application. We anticipate that readers will gain a more complete picture of the expansive possibilities for hydrogels to make practical and impactful differences across numerous fields and biomedical applications.},

However, hydrogel properties are determined by the cross-linking degree and nature, the tacticity, and the crystallinity of the polymer. These biomaterials can be sorted out according to the internal structure and by their response to external factors. In this case, the internal interaction can be reversible when the internal chains are led by physicochemical interactions. These physical hydrogels can be synthesized through several techniques such as crystallization, amphiphilic copolymers, charge interactions, hydrogen bonds, stereo-complexing, and protein interactions. In contrast, the internal interaction can be irreversible through covalent cross-linking. Synthesized hydrogels by chemical interactions present a high cross-linking density and are employed using graft copolymerization, reactive functional groups, and enzymatic methods. Moreover, specific smart hydrogels have also been denoted by their external response, pH, temperature, electric, light, and enzyme. This review deeply details the type of hydrogel, either the internal structure or the external response. Furthermore, we detail some of the main applications of these hydrogels in the biomedicine field, such as drug delivery systems, scaffolds for tissue engineering, actuators, biosensors, and many other applications.},

The resulting hybrid hydrogel exhibited extraordinary mechanical performance. It is found that the role of chemical and physical crosslinking was different during different deformation levels. The synergistic effects of chemical and physical crosslinking allow hydrogels to dissipate a large number of energy, significantly enhancing the mechanical strength of hydrogels.

  abstract = {Chemical bonds are central to chemistry, biology, and allied fields, but still, the criterion to characterize an interaction as a non-covalent bond has not been studied rigorously. Therefore, in this study, we have attempted to characterize the non-covalent bonds by considering a total of 85 model systems depicting different chemical bonds comprising 43 non-covalent and 42 other bonds such as covalent, ionic, and coordinate bonds. The characterization has been done based on interaction energy, energy decomposition analysis (EDA), the NCI plot, and the analysis of topological properties of electron density. The interaction energy values, energy decomposition analysis, and NCI plot give insights into the full understanding of bond strength and its nature, but they fail to distinctively characterize the interaction as a non-covalent bond. Herein, a special criterion has been developed based on the topological parameters to characterize an interaction as a non-covalent bond. Topological parameters illustrate that the values of both ∇2{$\rho$} and H(r) are positive with a value of {$\rho$} {$<$} 0.03 a.u. and [-G(r)/V(r)] {$\geq$} 1.00 for the non-covalent bonds. The value of {$\rho$} increases up to 0.06 a.u. with a positive value of ∇2{$\rho$} and a negative value of H(r) if the non-covalent bond is partially covalent in nature. The analysis of G(r) suggests that it dominates the H(r) of non-covalent bonds with greater than 50\% contribution, whereas the contribution of G(r) varies between 35 and 50\% in the case of bonds which are partially covalent in nature. The criterion based on topological parameters is likely to be very helpful to comprehend and ascertain the non-covalent bonds in the chemical as well as complex biological systems.},

These represent crucial characteristics in applications such as drug delivery and, more generally, in the biomedical world.

Cross linking is a stabilization process in polymer chemistry which leads to multidimensional extension of polymeric chain resulting in network structure. Cross-link is a bond which links one polymer chain to other. It can be ionic or covalent. Cross linking changes a liquid polymer into `solid' or `gel' by restricting the ability of movement. When polymer chains are linked together by cross-links, they lose some of their ability to move as individual polymer chains. A liquid polymer (where the chains are freely flowing) can be turned into a `solid' or `gel' by cross-linking the chains together. Cross linking increases the molecular mass of a polymer. Cross-linked polymers are important because they are mechanically strong and resistant to heat, wear and attack by solvents. However, the drawback associated with cross-linked polymers is that they are relatively inflexible when it comes to their processing properties because they are insoluble and infusible.},

  abstract = {As soft aqueous hydrogels have moved from new materials to the basis for real engineered devices in the last 20~years, their surface friction and lubrication are emerging as critical aspects of their function. The flexibility to alter and augment their mechanical and surface properties through control of the crosslinked 3D polymer networks has produced materials with diverse surface behaviors, even with the relatively simple composition of a single monomer and crosslink chemistry. Correspondingly with new understandings of the bulk behavior of hydrogels has been the identification of the mechanisms that govern the lubricity and frictional response under dynamic sliding conditions. Here we review these efforts, closely examining and identifying the internal and external influences that drive tribological response in high water content crosslinked hydrogels. The roles of surface structure, elasticity, contact response, charge, water interaction and water flow are addressed here as well as current synthesis and testing methods. We also collect open questions as well as the future needs to fully understand and exploit the surface properties of hydrogels for sliding performance.},
