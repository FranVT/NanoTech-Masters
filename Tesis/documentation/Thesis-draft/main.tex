\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis explores the theoretical framework necessary for analysing computational simulations of the mechanical response of a network under shear deformation.
This network is modelled on a hydrophilic polymeric network based on a PNIPAM microgel protocol.
The protocol has been implemented in LAMMPS to take advantage of the parallelisation of the velocity Verlet algorithm and Langevin dynamics.
It was found that the methodology simulates a polymeric network with physical crosslinkers and qualitatively captures the mechanical response as well as the network structure caused by shear deformation.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would want to thank my advisers for the time they have provided me over the last two years.
I would also like to acknowledge the research group that emerged during the master's program.
Of course, I appreciate my family's and partner's emotional support and patience.
And I would like to thank Tecnológico de Monterrey for the tuition grant that allowed me to continue with my master's studies.
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the UNAM for allowing me to use the LAVIS high-performance computing cluster.
