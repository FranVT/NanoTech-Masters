\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis addresses the theoretical framework required for analyzing computer simulations of a patchy particle network's mechanical response under shear deformation.
This network is modeled after a hydrophilic polymeric network composed by PNIPAM microgel numerical protocol.
The protocol has been implemented in LAMMPS to take advantage of the parallelization of the velocity Verlet algorithm to solve the Langevin equations for a many particle system.
It was found that the methodology simulates a polymeric network with physical crosslinkers and qualitatively captures the mechanical response as well as the network structure caused by shear deformation.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would want to thank my advisers for the time they have provided me over the last two years.
I would also like to acknowledge the research group that emerged during the master's program.
Of course, I appreciate my family's and partner's emotional support and patience.
And I would like to thank Tecnológico de Monterrey for the tuition grant that allowed me to continue with my master's studies.
Finally, this work recieved support from Luis Aguilar, Alejandro de León, Alejandro Ávalos and Jair García of the Laboratorio Nacional de Visualización Científica Avanzada.
