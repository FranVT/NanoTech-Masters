  abstract = {As soft aqueous hydrogels have moved from new materials to the basis for real engineered devices in the last 20~years, their surface friction and lubrication are emerging as critical aspects of their function. The flexibility to alter and augment their mechanical and surface properties through control of the crosslinked 3D polymer networks has produced materials with diverse surface behaviors, even with the relatively simple composition of a single monomer and crosslink chemistry. Correspondingly with new understandings of the bulk behavior of hydrogels has been the identification of the mechanisms that govern the lubricity and frictional response under dynamic sliding conditions. Here we review these efforts, closely examining and identifying the internal and external influences that drive tribological response in high water content crosslinked hydrogels. The roles of surface structure, elasticity, contact response, charge, water interaction and water flow are addressed here as well as current synthesis and testing methods. We also collect open questions as well as the future needs to fully understand and exploit the surface properties of hydrogels for sliding performance.},

Tunable soft and aqueous gels, also known as hydrogels, are one of the leading soft matter surrogates for active matter; 
they are engineered for both temporary and permanent medical prostheses such as catheter coatings, soft contact lenses, and valves [1]. 

Many of these devices interact directly with dynamic biological interfaces, fully integrated with metabolism, immune response, and other functions, all the while experiencing the mechanical environment of complex sliding speeds, bearing forces, and contact durations. 

Controlling the motions of slip, that is, the friction and lubrication, is critical to proper function. 
Crosslinked hydrogels are often thought to be inherently lubricious, but in fact there is a broad spectrum of friction and lubricating abilities. 

The lubrication of hydrogels was first described by lubricated sliding of engineering materials in that there are regimes of fluid-controlled lubrication and material-controlled lubrication that loosely resemble hydrodynamic and boundary friction, but the similarities past that are scant. 
Launched in part by seminal work by JP Gong summarized in a 2006 review of hydrogel lubrication [2], the field of hydrogel friction and lubrication has expanded quickly, with over 200 archival articles published since then under the topic of “hydrogel lubrication” as reported by Web of Science [3]. 

Efforts over the past ~ 20 years have sought to identify the ways in which the unique properties of hydrogels control their sliding behavior, which has subsequently required the development of new experimental techniques and data interpretation. 

The aim of this review is to present a summary of the most important considerations for hydrogel lubrication, including the mechanics of hydrogel materials, mechanisms of friction and lubrication, updated testing techniques, water-network interactions and flow, and surface structures and designs. 
A thorough understanding of the origins of hydrogel lubrication and friction will allow for their surfaces to be engineered for applications of the future.
