Colloids are used as model systems mainly because of the following features: 
    1) colloids and other macromolecules share similar length scales (10 nm - 1 µm), which renders them ‘visible’, and, as a consequence, they are relatively slow (typical time scales 1 µs - 1 s), which opens the possibility to follow colloidal dynamics and transport processes in real time, 
    2) the interactions between colloidal particles, of the order of the thermal energy, also describe the interaction between macromolecules immersed in an aqueous environment and can be tuned in a broad range, 
    3) since colloidal interactions are relatively weak, they are highly susceptible to external forces and hence their static and dynamical properties can be controlled through the application of external fields, and 
    4) colloidal suspensions can be studied on a single-particle level by means of different complementary techniques, i.e., experiments, computer simulations and theoretical approximations [1,2]. 
Hence, the understanding of the physical properties of colloidal suspensions allows us to give a qualitative and often quantitative description of Soft Materials, which have implications in Hard-Condensed Matter, Chemistry, Materials Science, Biology and Biotechnology, among other areas of Science.
