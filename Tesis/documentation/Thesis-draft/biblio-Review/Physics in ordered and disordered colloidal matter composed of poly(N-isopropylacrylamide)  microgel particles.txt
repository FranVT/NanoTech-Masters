  abstract = {This review collects and describes experiments that employ colloidal suspensions to probe physics in ordered and disordered solids and related complex fluids. The unifying feature of this body of work is its clever usage of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles. These temperature-sensitive colloidal particles provide experimenters with a `knob' for in situ control of particle size, particle interaction and particle packing fraction that, in turn, influence the structural and dynamical behavior of the complex fluids and solids. A brief summary of PNIPAM particle synthesis and properties is given, followed by a synopsis of current activity in the field. The latter discussion describes a variety of soft matter investigations including those that explore formation and melting of crystals and clusters, and those that probe structure, rearrangement and rheology of disordered (jammed/glassy) and partially ordered matter. The review, therefore, provides a snapshot of a broad range of physics phenomenology which benefits from the unique properties of responsive microgel particles.},

the utilization of colloids as model systems to study fundamental problems in statistical physics is not new [1]. 

Colloids composed of micrometer-sized particles, for example, have taught us a great deal about traditional atomic materials, with particles playing the role of atoms; such colloids are especially useful, because the suspended particles are small  enough to experience Brownian motion and large enough to be easily observed and tracked via optical microscopy. 
In addition, model colloid phenomenology offers a starting point for understanding the physics of a great many soft materials including dispersions, emulsions, pastes, paints, polymers, gels, and liquid crystals, and model colloids provide a bridge to non-equilibrium materials such as granular media and living cells and tissues. 
Importantly, the colloidal systems permit experimental access to both microscopic and macroscopic information, thus enabling microscopic and macroscopic properties to be directly linked.

In light of these complexities, it can be argued that the recent development of temperature-tunable colloidal microgel particles has been a boon for the field. In particular, poly(N isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel particles [24–27], and those based on other alkyl substituted polyacrylamides [25, 28–38], are now used as substitutes for traditional suspension constituents.



# Properties of PNIPAM Particles

[Hydrogels section]
PNIPAM hydrogel particles consist of crosslinked PNIPAM polymer chains and water (figure 1). The water has been suggested to be largely immobilized within the particle [24–27] due to strong hydrogen bonds between water and the amide groups of PNIPAM. The interaction between water and PNIPAM is a highly temperature-sensitive balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, especially near the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of approximately 32 ◦C.
