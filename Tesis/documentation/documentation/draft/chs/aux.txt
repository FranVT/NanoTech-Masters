  abstract = {Hybrid crosslinking hydrogels have exhibited excellent mechanical properties, however, the relationship between chemical and physical crosslinking in the various deformation stages is still indistinct. Here, a hybrid hydrogel was explored by inducing low density of chemical crosslinking into latex particle hydrogels (LP-Gel), in which latex particles act as physical crosslinking centers for inducing efficient aggregation of hydrophobic chains. The resulting hybrid hydrogel exhibited extraordinary mechanical performance. It is found that the role of chemical and physical crosslinking was different during different deformation levels. The synergistic effects of chemical and physical crosslinking allow hydrogels to dissipate a large number of energy, significantly enhancing the mechanical strength of hydrogels. Moreover, the hybrid hydrogel exhibited puncture resistant, excellent ductility and rapid recovery.},

Hybrid crosslinking hydrogels consist of covalent and noncovalent crosslinking.
The dynamic physical crosslinking could effectively dissipate energy via destruction and reorganization, and the chemical crosslinking could sustain skeleton construction.

H-Gel exhibited an identical curve with P-Gel, much higher than C-Gel.

  abstract = {Hydrogels based on reversible covalent bonds represent an attractive topic for research at both academic and industrial level. While the concept of reversible covalent bonds dates back a few decades, novel developments continue to appear in the general research area of gels and especially hydrogels. The reversible character of the bonds, when translated at the general level of the polymeric network, allows reversible interaction with substrates as well as responsiveness to variety of external stimuli (e.g., self-healing). These represent crucial characteristics in applications such as drug delivery and, more generally, in the biomedical world. Furthermore, the several possible choices that can be made in terms of reversible interactions generate an almost endless number of possibilities in terms of final product structure and properties. In the present work, we aim at reviewing the latest developments in this field (i.e., the last five years) by focusing on the chemistry of the systems at hand. As such, this should allow molecular designers to develop a toolbox for the synthesis of new systems with tailored properties for a given application.},

The molecular reversibility can be actually achieved in two different ways: either by making use of equilibrium reactions (e.g., the Diels-Alder one) or through dynamic exchange reactions (e.g., reaction of an excess amino groups with epoxide ones). Both approaches have been widely used for tuning the adhesion of different substrates on different polymeric networks and for the network formations (and disruption) itself.

The molecular reversibility can be achieved in two different ways: either by utilizing equilibrium reactions (e.g., the Diels-Alder reaction) or through dynamic exchange reactions (e.g., the reaction of an excess amino group with an epoxide group).

The same concept of covalent reversible bonds can be used for the hydrogel formation and disruption. Examples of interactions used in this case are (Figure 2) electrostatic ones [19,20], cycloadditions [8,21], redox reactions [22–24], and other ones such as imine [25–28] and enamine formation [29], acylhydrazone [30–33], and borax acid reaction with hydroxyls [13,34–36].

The general concept behind the use of reversible covalent interactions for the hydrogel polymeric chains is a the reversible network disruption with immediate release of any loading.

The general idea is that the use of dynamic covalent conds allows the polymeric network to adjust itself as a result of an external sitimulus.

This can be achieve in principle through other weaker ainteractions, e.g., hydrogen bonding.
In particullar, a clear trend is detected in the last year, according to which self-assembly driven processes [10,37] can be conveniently used for hydrogel preparation. 
However, the use of covalent bonds displays two distinct and clear advantages [25]. 
In first instance, the network is still covalently linked, which renders it quite robust against small random fluctuations in environmental conditions such as temperature. 
Furthermore, exchange reactions such as the one of an amine with an imine are often kinetically controlled by the use of catalysts. 
In turn, this allows the possibility to freeze the network conformation (by slowing the kinetics) when desired.

  abstract = {Hydrogels represent a class of high water content polymers with physical or chemical crosslinks. Their physical properties are similar to soft tissues. Cross linking is a stabilization process in polymer chemistry which leads to multidimensional extension of polymeric chain resulting in network structure. Cross-link is a bond which links one polymer chain to other. It can be ionic or covalent. Cross linking changes a liquid polymer into `solid' or `gel' by restricting the ability of movement. When polymer chains are linked together by cross-links, they lose some of their ability to move as individual polymer chains. A liquid polymer (where the chains are freely flowing) can be turned into a `solid' or `gel' by cross-linking the chains together. Cross linking increases the molecular mass of a polymer. Cross-linked polymers are important because they are mechanically strong and resistant to heat, wear and attack by solvents. However, the drawback associated with cross-linked polymers is that they are relatively inflexible when it comes to their processing properties because they are insoluble and infusible.},

Crosslinked material after absorbing lot of solvent is called a gel.

Hydrogels are crosslinked hydrophilic polymer structures

Their hydrophilic, soft and rubbery nature ensures minimal tissue irritation and a low tendency of cells and proteins to adhere to the hydrogel surface.

Adding cross-links between polymer chains affect the physical properties of the polymer depending upon the degree of cross linking and presence and absence of crystallinity. 

Cross linking results in:
i) elasticity Elastomers are elastic polymers created by limited cross-linking. As the number of cross-links increases, however, the polymer becomes more rigid and cannot stretch as much; the polymer will become less viscous and less elastic and might even become brittle.
ii) Decrease in the viscosity. In order to polymers to flow, the chains must move past each other and cross-linking prevent this.
iii) Insolubility of the polymer. Cross linking results in insolubility as the chains are tied together by strong covalent bonds.
Crosslinked materials cant't dissolve in solvents, but can absorb solvents.

# Method of Crosslinking

Cross-linking may occur through polymerization of monomers having functionalities more than two (by condensation) or by covalent bonding between polymeric chain through irradiation, sulphur vulcanization or chemical reactions by adding different chemicals in conjunction with heating and, sometimes, pressure.


# Hydrogels and Crosslinking

The term “hydrogel” represent water insoluble polymeric network that has capacity to absorb large amount of water [11-15]. 
A hydrogel is a macromolecular polymer gel constructed of a network of crosslinked polymer chains.
They are synthesized from hydrophlic monomers by either chain or step growth, along with a functional crosslinker to promote network formation. 
Synthetic or natural polymers, homopolymer or copolymer, are used to make three dimensional networks by molecular entanglements or by chemical crosslinking [16].

Cross linking either physically or chemically gives hydrogel a 3D network structure, making it insoluble. 
This insoluble cross-linked structure allows effective immobilization and release of active agents and biomolecules. 
Hydrogels appear similar to natural soft tissues because of their high water content.


Physical crosslinks include entangled chains, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction and crystallite formation. 
These physical crosslinks may not be permanent in nature, but they are sufficient to make hydrogels insoluble in an aqueous media. 
Physical crosslinking gives reversible hydrogels. 
Physical hydrogels can absorb the water but inhomogeneities or network defects may occur due to free chain ends or chain loops


Chemical or permanent hydrogel are formed by covalent crosslinking of polymers.

The type and degree of crosslinking influences many of the network properties, like swelling properties, elastic modulus and transport of molecules


# Synthesis of Hydrogels

Hydrogels are synthesized by different polymerization methods using both chemical and physical crosslinking routes.

## Chemical crosslinked

hydrogels are synthesized by chain growth polymerization, addition and condensation polymerization and gamma and electron beam polymerization.

Chain-growth polymerization includes free radical polymerization, controlled free radical polymerization, anionic and cationic polymerization.

Controlled living radical polymerizations offer the benefits of longer growing chain life compared to free radical polymerizations for macromolecular engineering

Anionic and Cationic polymerization methods suffer from extreme sensitivity toward aqueous environments and therefore, are not used in the synthesis of polymeric hydrogels.

Addition and condensation polymerization involves stepwise addition of Polyfunctional crosslinking agents with monomer functional groups.

Polymer chains may be crosslinked in the presence of water to form a hydrogel. 
Water occupies voids in the network, giving the hydrogel its characteristic surface properties.

Gamma and electron beam polymerization involves high energy electromagnetic irradiation as crosslinker. 
These high energy radiations can crosslink water-soluble monomer or polymer chain ends without the addition of a crosslinker.

## Physically crosslinked

hydrogels are synthesized by ionic interaction, crystallization, stereocomplex formation, hydrophobized polysaccharides, protein interaction and hydrogen bond.

In ionic interactions, hydrogels can be crosslinked under mild conditions, at room temperature and physiological pH.

Hydrophobic interactions results in the polymer to swell and uptake water that forms the hydrogel.

Protein interaction involves block copolymers that contains repetition of silk-like and elastine-like blocks called ProLastins

  abstract = {Hydrogels are attractive biomaterials with favorable characteristics due to their water uptake capacity. However, hydrogel properties are determined by the cross-linking degree and nature, the tacticity, and the crystallinity of the polymer. These biomaterials can be sorted out according to the internal structure and by their response to external factors. In this case, the internal interaction can be reversible when the internal chains are led by physicochemical interactions. These physical hydrogels can be synthesized through several techniques such as crystallization, amphiphilic copolymers, charge interactions, hydrogen bonds, stereo-complexing, and protein interactions. In contrast, the internal interaction can be irreversible through covalent cross-linking.

Moreover, specific smart hydrogels have also been denoted by their external response, pH, temperature, electric, light, and enzyme. This review deeply details the type of hydrogel, either the internal structure or the external response.

A hydrogel is a tridimensional polymeric structure with swelling and collapse properties, flexibility, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and softness.

The ability of hydrogels to absorb water arises from hydrophilic functional groups attached to the polymeric backbone, while their resistance to dissolution arises from crosslinks between network chains

Variations in concentrations, structure, functionality of the monomer, and the cross-linker used in such gels can modify the structure [4]

Monomers have unique properties that can form a macromolecular known as a polymer. 
In addition, a cross-linking agent is relevant because a characteristic of any hydrogel is its cross-linked structure, which is achieved through that agent [9,10]. 
The cohesion forces that allow the cross-linking of the polymer have a covalent character, and other forces such as electrostatic, hydrophobic, dipole–dipole interactions, or hydrogen bonds intervene [11–13]. 
Typically, hydrogels are classified into two categories: physically cross-linked hydrogels and chemically cross-linked hydrogels [14], which obtain different properties based on each synthesis.

Hydrophilic polymers might be considered as those polymers that contain polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), and amino (-NH2) groups that make them soluble or swelled by water.

A hydrophilic polymer that has received much attention is poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) because it has a great promise as a biological drug-delivery matrix [16] and is nontoxic.

hydrophilic polymers can be cross-linked through chemical bonds, leading to the formation of hydrogels

The research of hydrophilic polymers has been complex because the physical properties of solubility or swellability depend on different factors, such as the type of polymer, molecular weight, the ratio of polar groups, and degree of cross-linking.

# Crosslinking Strategies to Obtain Physical Hydrogels

Hydrogels can be cross-linked through physical or reversible networks, which hold them together by molecular entanglements or physicochemical interactions such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, charge condensation, or supramolecular chemistry. 
The interactions that occur in this type of hydrogels are weak. 
However, they are numerous and contribute to the presence of complex behaviors. 
Since the interactions depend significantly on external stimuli (pH, ionic strength, the composition of the solvent, or the temperature), they allow hydrogels to be highly versatile concerning the environment, unlike covalently bonded materials. 


## Crystalization

Physical cross-linking of a polymer to form a hydrogel can also be achieved by crystallization through freeze–thaw cycles in homopolymeric systems or by forming stereocomplexes.

Polymeric crystallization can occur from dilute solutions or the molten state

In the first case, crystallization occurs by evaporating the solvent, resulting in the appearance of single crystals based on a chain-folded model, which presents aligned chains

Freeze–thaw crystallization involves the formation of microcrystals in the structure.

Stereocomplexes are formed by stereoselective interactions between polymers with complementary stereoregular structures (the functional group is located only on one side of the monomer) that interact to form a system of properties different from those of the original constituents.

## Amphilic Copolymers

Amphiphilic hydrogels containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic units

amphiphilic copolymers can aggregate in water to form micelles and hydrogels in which the hydrophobic segments of the polymer self-assembly [40].

Copolymers typically form hydrogels with fragments of different nature or modified copolymers. 
The latter can be formed by a water-soluble polymer to which hydrophobic fragments have been attached or hydrophobic chains modified by water-soluble fragments [31].

Polymers with hydrophobic domains can also crosslink in aqueous environments through reverse thermal gelling (sol-gel transition).

Polymers or oligomers with this ability are known as gelling agents and are moderately hydrophobic [50–52]. 

Gelation occurs when a hydrophobic segment attaches to a hydrophilic polymer forming an amphiphilic polymer. 
Amphiphilic polymers are generally soluble in water at low temperatures; as the temperature increases, the hydrophobic domains add to minimize the hydrophobic surface area, reducing the amount of structured water around them [53]. 

Gelation temperature depends on the concentration of the polymer, the length of the hydrophobic block, and the chemical structure of the polymer.

## Hydrogel Cross-linking by Charge Interactions

Cross-linking (or de-crosslinking) can be achieved in situ by pH changes that cause ionization or protonation of ionic functional groups and cause gelation.

When a polyelectrolyte combines with a multivalent ion of opposite charge, a physical gel known as an ionotropic hydrogel is produced

If two polyelectrolytes of opposite charges are mixed, they can gel or precipitate depending on their concentration, ionic strength, and pH of the solution; the product is called complex or polyionic.


## Interaction by Hydrogen Bonds 

Hydrogen bonding interactions can be used to produce hydrogels in vitro by freezethaw cycles.

The hydrogels have unique properties through optimization between the radii of the monomers and a balance of the interactions [69].

These hydrogels were obtained in the absence of a cross-linker. 
The authors hypothesize that gelation occurred due to aggregation of polymer chains by regeneration of hydrogen bonds during dialysis [70].


## Stereo Complexing

Stereo-complexing refers to the interactions between polymeric chains, or small molecules, of the same chemical composition but different stereochemistry.

the main drawback of stereo- complexation is the restricted polymer composition range that can be used; small changes in stoichiometry can weaken or eliminate the stereochemical interaction

## Protein Interactions

Cross-linking by protein interactions can be accomplished through the use of genetically engineered proteins or antigen–antibody interactions.

The sol-gel transition can be controlled by modifying the temperature, the conditions of the solution, and the additives, which can prevent or promote the crystallization of the chain through hydrogen bonds


# Cross-Linking Strategies to Obtain Chemical Hydrogels

Hydrogels are called chemical or permanent when they consist of covalently crosslinked networks.

Similar to physical hydrogels, chemical hydrogels are not homogeneous. 
It generally contains regions of the high cross-linking density and low degree of swelling (clusters), dispersed in the regions of the low cross-linking density and high swelling index. 
The presence of these clusters is due to the hydrophobic aggregation of the cross-linking agent. 
In some cases, depending on the composition, solvent, temperature, and solids’ concentration during gelation, phase separation can occur with the formation of macropores [51].

## Graft Copolymerization and Irradiation Crosslinking

Among the various techniques for grafting polymers, gamma radiation has been successfully developed to graft polymers onto polymeric materials
This technique does not require initiators or additives that may be harmful and difficult to remove

Both the polymerization reaction and the cross-linking can be started at room temperature. 
This radiation acts as an initiator of the copolymerization process between the polymer matrix (the material) and the molecule to be grafted (monomer). 
This method allows radiation to act on the polymer matrix, inducing the formation of reactive sites that may interact with a molecule to be grafted, initiating a free radical polymerization process

## Reactive Functional Groups

These are covalent reactions between the functional groups of the polymers (mainly -OH, -COOH, -NH2) that provide solubility to water-soluble polymers

Covalent bonds between polymer chains are established by the reaction of functional groups that have complementary reactivity; typical reactions are the formation of Schiff bases [101], Michael-type additions [102], peptide bonds [103], and click-type reactions [104].

## Enzymatic Method

The main advantage of the enzymatic method is that the cross-linking of the hydrogel occurs under mild conditions without the need for the use of low molecular weight compounds (monomers, initiators, cross-linking agents), irradiation, or prior polymer functionalization to favor its cross-linking [31,119].

Enzymes often exhibit a high degree of substrate specificity, potentially avoiding side reactions during cross-linking. This advantage makes it possible to control and predict the cross-linking kinetics and control the overall cross-linking rate. For this reason, this method is suitable for in situ gelation systems [119,120].
