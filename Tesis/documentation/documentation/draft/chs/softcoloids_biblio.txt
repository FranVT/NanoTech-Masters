  abstract = {Hydrogels are polymer networks infiltrated with water. Many biological hydrogels in animal bodies such as muscles, heart valves, cartilages, and tendons possess extreme mechanical properties including being extremely tough, strong, resilient, adhesive, and fatigue-resistant. These mechanical properties are also critical for hydrogels' diverse applications ranging from drug delivery, tissue engineering, medical implants, wound dressings, and contact lenses to sensors, actuators, electronic devices, optical devices, batteries, water harvesters, and soft robots. Whereas numerous hydrogels have been developed over the last few decades, a set of general principles that can rationally guide the design of hydrogels using different materials and fabrication methods for various applications remain a central need in the field of soft materials. This review is aimed at synergistically reporting: (i) general design principles for hydrogels to achieve extreme mechanical and physical properties, (ii) implementation strategies for the design principles using unconventional polymer networks, and (iii) future directions for the orthogonal design of hydrogels to achieve multiple combined mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological properties. Because these design principles and implementation strategies are based on generic polymer networks, they are also applicable to other soft materials including elastomers and organogels. Overall, the review will not only provide comprehensive and systematic guidelines on the rational design of soft materials, but also provoke interdisciplinary discussions on a fundamental question: why does nature select soft materials with unconventional polymer networks to constitute the major parts of animal bodies?},

As hydrophilic polymer networks infiltrated with water,1 hydrogels

The pioneering works in the field of polymers and soft materials have laid the foundation for understanding the elasticity, swelling, poroelasticity, viscoelasticity, fracture, and fatigue of hydrogels (e.g., refs 53−66 and the references therein).

how to design hydrogels that possess certain mechanical properties or certain properties in generalstill poses a grand challenge in the  field of polymers and soft materials.

For example, cartilage is a tough connective tissue that covers the surfaces of joints to  provide reduced friction.79 
The human knee joint cartilage (i.e., articular cartilage) typically needs to sustain compressive stresses of 4−9 MPa for 1 million cycles per year, while  maintaining high fracture toughness around 1000 J m−2 (Figure  2a).80 
The high fracture toughness of articular cartilage is mainly attributed to its abundant strong collagen fibers interpenetrated with proteoglycan macromolecules. 
This structure of articular cartilage provides both viscoelasticity and poroelasticity for  mechanical dissipation.81,82 
The viscoelasticity of articular cartilage is mainly associated with local rearrangement of aggrecan, adhesive interactions of aggrecan, and reconfiguration  of collagen;82 the poroelasticity of articular cartilage is governed by the interstitial fluid movement through the porous  extracellular matrix.81

The fatigue-resistant adhesion of soft tissues (e.g., tendons, ligaments, and cartilages) to rigid bones is commonly achieved through nanostructured interfaces composed of aligned collagen nanofibrils and ordered  hydroxyapatite nanocrystals.

What are nature’s design principles for various biological hydrogels besides the abovementioned ones (Figure 2) to achieve extreme mechanical properties?


many extreme mechanical and physical properties were first achieved in other soft materials than hydrogels. For example, high values of fracture toughness, tensile strength, resilience, and interfacial toughness were realized in elastomers long before in hydrogels; ferromagnetic domains in soft materials were first programmed and 3D printed with  elastomeric inks as well.38,39


# Common Polymers and Crosslinks for Hydrogels

A rich library of polymers and cross-links have been used for the design and fabrication of various hydrogels.
These polymers can be broadly categorized into natural polymers and synthetic polymers. 
In this section, we will briefly discuss the commonly used natural polymers, synthetic polymers, and permanent covalent cross-links for hydrogels. 
We will discuss other types of cross-links for hydrogels in section 4.


## Natural Polymers for Hydrogels

- Alginate: Alginate is a polysaccharide usually obtained from brown-algae cell walls and two kinds of bacteria,  Azotobacter and Pseudomonas.
Alginate hydrogels can be formed with various covalent and physical cross-links.

- Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic acid (also known as hyaluronan or hyaluronate) is a linear polymer of disaccharides, which is composed of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-Dglucosamine, linked together via alternating β-(1 → 4)-linked  and β-(1 → 3)-linked glycosidic bonds.
Hyaluronic acid can be covalently cross-linked into  hydrogels by various hydrazide derivatives.136,137

- Collagen: Collagen is one of the major proteins in animal bodies. 
There are approximately 29 types of collagens  discovered so far.161 
The structures of collagens can be defined at different levels, including primary structure (amino acid triplet), secondary structure (α-helix), tertiary structure (triple  helix), and quaternary structure (fibril).162,163
Three left-handed α-helix polypeptide chains then form a tertiary structure via the aldol condensation cross-linking, aldehyde amine condensation cross-linking, and aldol histidine cross-linking.165
Acid-solubilized collagens can self-assemble to form physically cross-linked hydrogels when the collagen solutions are neutralized and heated.
Since the physically cross-linked collagen hydrogels are usually mechanically weak and thermally unstable,167,168

- Gelatin: Gelatins are naturally derived polymers obtained through breaking the triple-helix structures of collagens into single-strand molecules. 
There are two types of gelatins, type A and type B, which are obtained with acid and  alkaline treatments of collagens, respectively.185 Gelatins can be physically cross-linked by simply reducing the temperature of  aqueous solutions of gelatins below a certain temperature.186,187

- Fibrin

- Agarose

- Chitosan 

- Cellulose 


## Synthetic Polymers for Hydrogels

- Poly(acrylic acid)

- Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)

- Poly(vinyl alcohol)

- Poly(ethylene glycol) or Poly(ethylene oxide)

- Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)

- Silicone

## Permanent Covalent Cross-links for Hydrogels

In this subsection, we will discuss permanent covalent crosslinks that are commonly used in hydrogels (Figure 5c). 
We will discuss other types of cross-links in section 4. 
The energy of  permanent covalent cross-links ranges from 220 kJ mol−1 to 570  kJ mol−1 (Figure 6).385−387

- Carbon-Carbon Bonds

- Carbon-Nitrogen Bonds

- Carbon-Oxygen Bonds

- Carbon-Sulfide Bonds

# Conventional Polymer Networks

a conventional polymer network is defined as polymer chains cross-linked via permanent covalent bonds into a network, in which entanglements, physical crosslinks, and reversible cross-links of the polymer chains are  negligible.54,57,62

Conventional polymer networks have provided the basic models for the development of unentangled rubber elasticity, including the affine network model and the  phantom network model.54,57,62 
Conventional polymer networks have also been widely adopted in synthetic hydrogels, although biological hydrogels (Figures 1 and 2) generally rely on unconventional polymer networks which will be discussed in section 4.


# Unconventional polymer networks

Section 3 has established that elastomers and hydrogels with conventional polymer networks have intrinsically coupled mechanical properties, including shear modulus, stretch limit, fracture toughness, fatigue threshold, interfacial toughness of adhesion, and interfacial fatigue threshold of adhesion (eqs 6 and 11). 

This section will discuss unconventional polymer networks (UPNs), which constitute most biological hydrogels (Figures 1 and 2) and have been widely used in synthetic hydrogels to achieve extreme mechanical properties.
The UPNs are defined as polymer networks that are different from the conventional polymer networks in terms of the architectures of the networks and/or the interactions among  polymer chains in the networks.70,438−446 
Therefore, the UPNs can be broadly classified into two categories: the UPN architectures and the UPN interactions.

## Unconventional Polymer Network Architectures

### Polymer Networks with Slidable Cross-links

### Interpenetrating and Semi-interprenetrating polymer networks

### Polymer Networks with High-functionality cross-links



## Unconventional Polymer Network Interactions

As illustrated in Figure 10, the UPN interactions are defined as interpolymer and intrapolymer interactions that are different from those in the conventional polymer networks (i.e., permanent covalent cross-links, excluded volumes, and osmotic interactions) (Figure 10). 
The UPN interactions are vastly  abundant in biological organisms,541 and the UPN interactions have been intensively studied for the design of soft materials such as elastomers, hydrogels and organogels to achieve extreme  mechanical properties among many other purposes.254 
On the basis of the nature of the UPN interactions, they can be broadly  classified into three categories:62 strong physical cross-links, weak physical cross-links, and dynamic covalent cross-links (Figure 10 and Table 2).

### Strong Physical Cross-Links

### Weak Physical Cross-Links

### dynamic Covalent Cross-Links

### Decoupled Mechanical Properties Due to Unconventional Polymer Network Interactions

  abstract = {Microgels are colloidal-scale particles individually made of cross-linked polymer networks that can swell and deswell in response to external stimuli, such as changes to temperature or pH. Despite a large amount of experimental activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles in silico. We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent (cross-linkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our assembly protocol, we focus on a small microgel test case and show that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated assembly methodologies, e.g., in the case of networks generated from an underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely used fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modeling of microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.},

Soft colloids, combining properties of hard-sphere colloids and polymers, offer the interesting possibility to tailor their  macroscopic behavior and flow at the molecular level.

Hard sphere colloids have served for decades as a reference model to shed light on many physics problems, such as the structure of  atomic liquids,2 crystal nucleation,3 and the glass transition.4−6 Recently, however, soft colloids have become even more  popular in the scientific community.7 
Typically, soft particles have an internal polymeric architecture, which allows them to  reach the paste regime,8 where particles are in very dense, squeezed (or jammed) states.


Since the single-particle elasticity alters the properties of the resulting macroscopic material, establishing the crucial link between microscopic properties and macroscopic response requires the knowledge of the effective interactions among particles.

# fundamental principles of soft matter physics in food science

Soft matter constitutes a distinct class of condensed matter characterized by: (1) structural organization at intermediate length scales (nanometers to micrometers) between atomic and macroscopic dimensions; (2) high susceptibility to deformation by thermal uctuations or weak external forces (stresses on the order of 106 to 103 Pa); (3) non-equilibrium behaviors including metastability, path-dependence, and structural relaxation phenomena; and (4) emergent physical properties that arise from collective interactions rather than individual molecular attributes.3
These materials including polymers, colloids, foams, emulsions, gels, and liquid crystals exhibit dual solidlike and liquid-like properties depending on observation timescales and applied stresses, a phenomenon quantied through viscoelastic parameters.


## Key principle: Thermodynamics, phase transistions, and molecular dynamics

Soft matter physics is governed by several key principles, including thermodynamics, phase transitions, and molecular dynamics, which collectively determine the behavior and properties of soft materials.

Molecular dynamics, which involves the simulation of particle motion at the atomic or molecular scale, provides insights into the kinetic behaviors and structural evolution of soft matter systems. 
These simulations have been instrumental in modeling the self-assembly of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipid molecules in food systems, helping researchers predict the formation of various structures and textures in foods.14


### Colloidal systems in foods. 

Colloidal systems represent a fundamental category of so matter characterized by dispersions where one phase is distributed within another at length scales typically ranging from nanometers to micrometers.

At high packing fractions, the system displays compressed exponentialdecay of the intermediate scattering functions and super-diffusive behaviour of themean-squared displacements.

}

In recent years, colloidal particles have emerged as useful models that give access to phases and states with no counterpart in atomic and molecular systems [1–3].

A crucial parameter controlling colloidal behaviour is particle softness, which can be quantified by the ratio between elastic and thermal energy [10].

Several experimental works [9, 11–13] reported that softness controls the dependence of the structural relaxation time τα on temperature T or on packing fraction ζ – the so called fragility[14].

Landau, L. D. & Lifshitz, E. Theory of elasticity, vol. 7. Course of Theoretical Physics 3, 109 (1986).

To gain microscopic knowledge on this matter (a frigile system), we usually resort on simulations of simple repulsive models, as for example systems interacting with the Hertzian potential [18], which is found to describe microgel particles behavior at moderate packing fractions [19, 20], but is expected to fail in denser conditions where soft colloids tend to shrink, deform or even interpenetrate [21].


Early works have indicated that, for such simple pair potentials, the change of dynamic properties with softness, such as the change of fragility, is modest [22] or absent [23]. 
In these approaches, softness is tuned by modifying a given parameter, e.g. the strength of the repulsion, allowing particles to overlap to a certain extent, but without taking into account their deformability as well as other important aspects in realistic soft particles, namely deswelling [24–27], interpenetration [21] and faceting [28]. 
Thus, there is a strong need to go one step forward in the modeling of soft colloids to tackle this problem and to provide a microscopic picture of these systems at high densities.

On a local level we use a Flory--Rehner inspired model that focuses on highly swollen networks, characterized by a Poisson's ratio of 1/4. Our ab initio calculations take account for the nonuniform distribution of crosslinker species during the synthesis of poly(N-isopropylacylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels, yet the method is also applicable to other microgel architectures.

Microgels are sub-micron sized particles with a backbone of crosslinked polymer.
They offer high control (in situ) over shape, size, charge,1,2 and soft interactions3,4 by stimuli such as temperature, pH,5,6 or salt concentration.7

Poly(Nisopropylacylamide) (PNIPAM) polymers exhibit a temperature induced volume phase transition from coil9 to globule around 33 degrees Celsius10 and can be shaped into microgels via precipitation polymerization.11 
This yields particles that reversibly change from a nearly-incompressible sphere to a swollen network upon varying the temperature, which can be used to explore novel routes towards complex structure formation, opens new possibilities for drug delivery12–14 and cell cultivation,15 or can be used to design fluids with adjustable rheological properties.16,17 
The addition of crosslinkers during synthesis is essential for creating stable hydrogel cores and increasing the amount of crosslinkers results in more rigid particles. 
Crosslinkers get predominantly incorporated early during the particle synthesis process due to a different reactivity of the crosslinker species and the NIPAM monomers. 
The resulting particle has, therefore, a relatively dense core and a much softer surface region.18–24 
Dispersing the crosslinker more homogeneously throughout the particle can be promoted by a controlled feed of crosslinker into the reaction mixture.21,25

[So a hydrogel is a type of microgel]

The precise internal structure of the particles and how this quantitatively affects the properties of the suspension is, however, still unclear.


[The importance of crosslinker in the mechanical response]
The celebrated model for describing the swelling of hydrogels is the Flory–Rehner theory,28–30 which has originally been derived to analyze the elastic properties of rubber-like materials.
This model can be used to capture the volume phase transition that is observed for PNIPAM microgels, yet it has been unsuccessful in predicting the elastic moduli and soft interactions between the particles.24
Deviations from bulk-gel behavior due to the crosslinker density gradient may be attributed to this.

It has been suggested by Fernandes et al. that a spatially varying crosslinker distribution can be considered by means of a ‘matryoshka’ approach, i.e. by considering the gel particle as a collection of shells with different gel parameters.31


# Theory and model 

## Homogeneous hydrogels

Swelling of charge-neutral hydrogels is induced by excludedvolume interactions between the segments that constitute the polymer network.

Based on numerical calculations we propose a multi-Hertzian model, which reproduces the experimental behavior for all studied conditions.

Microgels are hybrid particles with dual colloid-polymer nature, belonging to the class of so-called soft  colloids
A microgel consists of a mesoscopic crosslinked polymer network, which can deform, shrink or interpenetrate with another microgel3,4.
Often, as a result of the synthesis conditions, a particle possesses a denser core and a  more loosely crosslinked corona5,6, which also includes so-called  dangling ends7,8.

Microgels are considered smart colloidal materials: in response to external parameters such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, light, or electric field (depending on the nature of the polymers) a particle is able to change its size as well as  other connected properties such as the polarizability9 or elasticity  of the particle10,11.

[Pero a que rangos dimensionales? Cuál es el rango de tamaño del que se refiere?]
Recent research shows that the interactions between swollen microgels can be more accurately reproduced by a soft Hertzian repulsion in  the fluid region of the phase diagram33, while brush-like models  can be used for highly packed samples34,35.



Evidently, it is imperative to consider the variation of the interparticle potential upon changing temperature and, crucially, the internal structure of the microgels to correctly describe their behavior, particularly for conditions where microgels are forced together—for example, in electric field applications or in the dense glassy regime, which is most widely studied in the microgel literature. 
Furthermore, our results raise fundamental questions on the widespread practice to tune the volume fraction via a temperature change without accounting for the different nature of the system.

Despite their widespread use, little is known about how these soft particles adapt their shape and size under strong mechanical compression. We use a combination of precise labeling protocols and two-color superresolution microscopy to unravel the behavior of tracer microgels inside densely packed soft solids.

Microgels are among the most studied colloidal and polymeric systems of the past two decades (1–4). 

In particular, microgels made from thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and its derivatives are of interest (5).
By decorating and functionalizing microgels with nanoparticles, one can add additional optical, chemical, or magnetic sensitivity (6–9).

Swelling the microgel by lowering the temperature can drive a colloidal suspension from the liquid to the solid state, conveniently crossing the glass and the jamming transition without the need to prepare samples of varying composition (10–13).

microgels can be highly overpacked, meaning that the effective volume fraction zeff can be much larger than one (10, 17, 18)


To understand the microstructural changes at high packing densities, it is important to be aware of the complex architecture of individual colloidal microgel particles. 
In microgels, the internal cross-link density is not homogeneous, and moreover, microgels have a fuzzy corona with dangling polymer chains (23). 

The brush-like interactions mediated by these dangling ends can have a profound influence on the onset of repulsive interactions when the microgels swell into contact (11). 
The low-density polymer corona may also allow for deformation and even some mutual interpenetration between adjacent microgels (24). 
Thus, the architecture of swollen microgels permits different competing packing mechanisms such as shape deformation, interpenetration, and compression. 

The main goal of our work is to quantify their relative contribution by nanoscale imaging microgels based on dSTORM (direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) superresolution microscopy (19, 25, 26). 
To this end, we fluorescently label a small subset of microgels and record ultrahigh-resolution two-dimensional (2D) optical image sections. 
The combination of precise labeling protocols and superresolution techniques allows us to map out the different contributions from the marginally jammed state to the deeply overpacked regime. 


# Results

## Microgel properties 

Although the microgels investigated in this study are about 1 mm in diameter, the structural transformations we aim to characterize, as a function of packing density, occur on a significantly smaller length scale.

  abstract = {Soft particles such as polymeric microgels can form ultra-dense phases, where the average center-to-center distance as can be smaller than the initial unperturbed particle diameter {$\sigma$}0, due to their ability to interpenetrate and compress. However, despite of the effort devoted to microgels at ultrahigh densities, we know surprisingly little about their response to their environment at effective volume fractions {$\phi$}effabove close packing ({$\phi$}cp), and the existing information is often contradictory. Here we report direct measurements of the size and shape of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels at concentrations below and above {$\phi$}cpusing the zero average contrast method in small-angle neutron scattering. We complement these experiments with measurements of the average interparticle distances using small-angle x-ray scattering, and a determination of the glass transition using dynamic light scattering. This allows us to unambiguously decouple interaction effects from density-dependent variations of the particle size and shape at all values of {$\phi$}eff. We demonstrate that the microgels used in this study significantly interpenetrate and thus change their size and shape only marginally even for {$\phi$}eff\,{$\gg$}\,{$\phi$}cp, a finding that may require changes in the interpretation of a number of previously published studies on the structural and dynamic properties of dense soft particle systems.},

Microgel particles are intriguing soft and responsive colloids formed by a cross-linked polymeric structure that can undergo reversible continuous or discontinuous volume transitions upon variations of external stimuli such  as temperature, pH or ionic strength1–3.

In particular thermoresponsive particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)-based microgels have been used recently as seemingly ideal model systems to investigate various  “hot” topics in the physics of crystallisation and melting, dynamical arrest, glass transition and jamming4–8.

These microgel-based investigations have often relied on the ability of the particles to vary their size as a function of temperature, and used temperature as a convenient way to tune the particle size and thus the volume fraction.

Given the fact that microgels can in principle adapt both their size as well as their shape in response to the environment, any attempt to understand the structural and dynamic properties of dense microgel dispersions thus requires quantitative information about the behaviour of the individual particle as a function of temperature and density.

Despite the large number of publications dealing with dense soft particle suspensions, glasses and gels, there is indeed a surprising lack of information about the evolution of the size and shape of soft microgels with increasing concentration at and above close packing.

Thermoresponsive microgels of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) cross-linked with N,N{$\prime$}-methylenebis(acrylamide) acted as cores for the polymerization. During the surfactant-free polymerization, the core microgels shrank at 70 {$^\circ$}C to provide thermoresponsive composite microgels, and the polystyrene particles attached to core microgels became bigger with increasing styrene concentration. Conversely, composite microgels synthesized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ([SDS] {$>$} 6.5 mM) did not exhibit thermoresponsive deswelling behavior because polystyrene particles covered the core microgels. In particular, polystyrene particles formed composites on the microgel surface as well as inside the microgels when the SDS concentration exceeded a critical value for core microgel swelling at 70 {$^\circ$}C. A mechanism is proposed based on these results for the seeded emulsion polymerization of water-immiscible monomers with microgels.},

Hydrogel particles, or microgels, are cross-linked waterswellable polymeric particles that exhibit interesting stimuliresponsive physical/chemical properties.

These properties change in response to external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, light, presence of biomolecules, and  chemical reaction,1−9 making microgels suitable for various applications.


The design and control of chemical composition and microgel morphology play an important role for realizing specific applications.

  abstract = {Dispersions of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel thermally gel in the presence of inorganic salts. The in situ-formed hydrogels, with a network of soft particles, represent a new type of colloidal gels. Here, their fractal structures were determined by rheological measurements, using the models of both Shih et al. and Wu and Morbidelli. According to the definition of Shih et al., the colloidal PNIPAM gels fall into the strong-link regime. Yet the calculated fractal dimension of the floc backbone, x, yielded unrealistic negative values, suggesting this model is inapplicable for the present system. The Wu--Morbidelli model gives physically sounder results. According to this model, the strengths of the inter- and intrafloc links are comparable, and the in situ-formed gels are in the transition regime. The fractal dimension, df, of the hydrogel decreases from {$\sim$}2.5 to {$\sim$}1.8 when the heating temperature increases from 34 to 40 {$^\circ$}C. The df values suggest different aggregation mechanisms at different temperatures, that is, a reaction-limited one accompanied by rearrangement at low temperature, a typical reaction-limited one at the intermediate temperature, and a diffusion-limited one at high temperature. With increasing salt concentration, the df of the hydrogel decreases from {$\sim$}2.1 to {$\sim$}1.7, suggesting the aggregation mechanism changes from reaction-limited to diffusion-limited. The effects of both temperature and salt concentration can be explained by the changes in the interactions among the microgel particles. The thermogellable PNIPAM microgel dispersions may serve as a model system for the study of heat-induced gelation of globular proteins.},

Microgels are small hydrogel particles with a size ranging from  tens of nanometers to several micrometers.1,2

The network structure of the new hydrogel is reminiscent of that of colloidal gels.10 It is well-known that a lot of colloidal dispersions lose their colloidal stability and flocculate when the interactions among the colloidal particles become attractive.

The core dominates light scattering turbidity behavior whereas the colloid stability is determined by the hydrogel shell.


Most of the work discussed in this review involves microgels based on N-isopropylacrylamide. However, related monomers also yield polymers which have a lower critical solution temperature in water and a few of these monomers have been used wx  to make temperature-sensitive hydrogels.

  abstract = {Double-network hydrogels (DN gels) have aroused considerable interest because of their excellent mechanical strength and toughness, low sliding friction, good biocompatibility, as well as wide tunability in components. By revisiting DN gels, we provide an ingenious way to fabricate a kind of strong and tough microgel-reinforced hydrogels (MR gels), that densely cross-linked polyelectrolyte microgels of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic sodium) (PNaAMPS) (replacing the densely cross-linked PNaAMPS macro-network for conventional DN gels) are incorporated into sparsely cross-linked neutral polyacrylamide (PAAm) matrix. The structure of MR gels can be considered as a two-phase composite, where the disperse phase is the rigid DN microgels, and the continuous phase is the soft PAAm matrix. Similar to DN gels, MR gels show the irreversible energy dissipation in the hysteresis measurement, demonstrating the permanent fracture of the brittle PNaAMPS phase. Thus, the discontinuous brittle phase also serves as sacrificial bonds. Through quantitative comparison of the hysteresis curves with DN gels and monitoring the morphology change of the embedded microgels in MR gels during the real-time stretching process, we conclude that the DN microgels in MR gels show four times higher in fracture efficiency of the sacrificial bonds than bulk DN gels at the same strain, as a result of the stress concentration around the microgels.},

Hydrogel science and engineering is a field of important research today where the quest for the Holey Grail is clearly to reinforce the mechanical strength and toughness of these soft materials.

Various solutions have been proposed to solve the paradox of tough hydrogels since 2001, like double-network hydrogels (DN),1 slide-ring hydrogels (SR),2 nanocomposite hydrogels (NC),3 etc.


Our previous studies have shown that the strength and toughness of sparsely cross-linked neutral polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels containing densely cross-linked polyelectrolyte microgels of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic sodium) (PNaAMPS) is comparable to the conventional bulk DN gels at their optimal formulation, where the volume fraction of PNaAMPS microgels and the molar ratio of the PAAm to the PNaAMPS in the microgel phase are two critical parameters.27 
These hydrogels, named as microgel-reinforced hydrogels (MR gels), can be regarded as a two-phase composite, where the disperse phase is the rigid double-network (DN) microgels, and the continuous phase is the sof t PAAm matrix.

In this work, we make a comparison in hysteresis behavior between DN gels and MR gels, in terms of modulus and dissipated energy. 
Through monitoring the morphology change of the embedded microgels in MR gels during the real-time stretching process, we compare the fracture efficiency of covalent carbon−carbon (C−C) bonds in polyelectrolyte phase between bulk DN gels and DN microgels in MR gels. 
Finally, we explore the origin of the difference in their fracture efficiency from the point of view of the stress concentration around the microgels in the two-phase composite MR  hydrogels.

  abstract = {Microgel-reinforced (MR) hydrogels are tough hydrogels with dispersed rigid microgels embedded in a continuous soft matrix. MR gels have the great potential to provide not only mechanical toughness but also the desired functional matrix by incorporation of various functional microgels. Understanding the toughening mechanism of the MR hydrogels is critical for the rational design of the desired functionally tough MR gels. However, our current knowledge of the toughening mechanism of MR gels mainly comes from the MR hydrogels with both chemically crosslinked dispersed microgels and a continuous matrix. Little is known about the hybrid MR gels with physically crosslinked microgels embedded in a chemically crosslinked matrix. Herein, we synthesize such hybrid MR hydrogels with the ionic crosslinked calcium alginate microgels incorporated into the chemically crosslinked polyacrylamide (PAAm) matrix. The alginate microgels show strong size and modulus effects on the toughening enhancement: the larger microgels could toughen the MR gels more than the small ones, and the microgels with medium modulus could maximize the toughness of the MR gels. By comparison of the mechanical performances of the MR and the corresponding double network (DN) hydrogels, we have proposed that the hybrid MR gels may have the same toughening mechanism as the bulk DN gel. This work tries to better understand the structure--property relationships of both MR and DN gels and help in the design of more functionally tough MR gels with the desired properties.},

In the past decades, to address the mechanical limitation of the conventional synthetic hydrogels, scientists have developed a variety of synthetic strategies to fabricate hydrogels with improved mechanical strength and toughness,1, 2 such as double network (DN) hydrogels,3-5 topological or sliding-ring hydrogels,6, 7 nanocomposite hydrogels,8-11 macromolecular microsphere composite hydrogels,12, 13 and supramolecular hydrogels.14-16

One of the key elements to construct the tough hydrogels is to introduce the effective sacrificial bonds which could rupture to effectively dissipate energy upon deformation.2, 4, 5

For example, DN hydrogels comprise two separately crosslinked polymer networks. 
The first network of the DN hydrogel is often rigid and brittle, which is normally served as the “sacrificial network” to dissipate energy and increase resistance against crack propagation upon loading. 
Meanwhile, the second network is soft and ductile, which maintains the high stretchability and integrity after the fracture of the first network.4, 5


Inspired by the DN hydrogel, microgel-reinforced (MR) hydrogels use the dispersed densely crosslinked microgels as the sacrificial bonds to toughen the matrix.21, 25-27
