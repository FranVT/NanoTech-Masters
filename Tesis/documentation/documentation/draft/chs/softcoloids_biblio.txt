  abstract = {Microgels are colloidal-scale particles individually made of cross-linked polymer networks that can swell and deswell in response to external stimuli, such as changes to temperature or pH. Despite a large amount of experimental activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles in silico. We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent (cross-linkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our assembly protocol, we focus on a small microgel test case and show that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated assembly methodologies, e.g., in the case of networks generated from an underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely used fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modeling of microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.},

Soft colloids, combining properties of hard-sphere colloids and polymers, offer the interesting possibility to tailor their  macroscopic behavior and flow at the molecular level.

Hard sphere colloids have served for decades as a reference model to shed light on many physics problems, such as the structure of  atomic liquids,2 crystal nucleation,3 and the glass transition.4−6 Recently, however, soft colloids have become even more  popular in the scientific community.7 
Typically, soft particles have an internal polymeric architecture, which allows them to  reach the paste regime,8 where particles are in very dense, squeezed (or jammed) states.


Since the single-particle elasticity alters the properties of the resulting macroscopic material, establishing the crucial link between microscopic properties and macroscopic response requires the knowledge of the effective interactions among particles.

This review explores the application of soft matter principles in food science, from molecular interactions to macroscopic structuring. The behavior of food materials under various stresses and environmental conditions is governed by key physical principles including thermodynamics, phase transitions, and molecular dynamics. These principles elucidate how protein-polysaccharide networks, colloidal assemblies, and emulsified systems determine food texture, stability, and sensory properties. Rheology, a central tool of soft matter science, enables quantitative analysis of viscoelastic properties, guiding product design, formulation, and processing optimization. Processing techniques such as extrusion, high-pressure processing, and 3D printing are examined through the lens of soft matter behavior, offering precise control over microstructure and texture. Furthermore, the review highlights the emerging integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in modeling and predicting the physicochemical properties of complex food matrices, accelerating innovation and quality control. By bridging molecular--scale interactions with macro-scale material behavior, soft matter physics enables the rational design of functional, sustainable, and consumer-appealing food products. This interdisciplinary perspective not only advances fundamental scientific understanding but also provides practical insights for improving food quality, safety, and personalization. Overall, the review underscores the transformative potential of soft matter physics in shaping the future of food science and engineering.},

# fundamental principles of soft matter physics in food science

Soft matter constitutes a distinct class of condensed matter characterized by: (1) structural organization at intermediate length scales (nanometers to micrometers) between atomic and macroscopic dimensions; (2) high susceptibility to deformation by thermal uctuations or weak external forces (stresses on the order of 106 to 103 Pa); (3) non-equilibrium behaviors including metastability, path-dependence, and structural relaxation phenomena; and (4) emergent physical properties that arise from collective interactions rather than individual molecular attributes.3
These materials including polymers, colloids, foams, emulsions, gels, and liquid crystals exhibit dual solidlike and liquid-like properties depending on observation timescales and applied stresses, a phenomenon quantied through viscoelastic parameters.


## Key principle: Thermodynamics, phase transistions, and molecular dynamics

Soft matter physics is governed by several key principles, including thermodynamics, phase transitions, and molecular dynamics, which collectively determine the behavior and properties of soft materials.

Molecular dynamics, which involves the simulation of particle motion at the atomic or molecular scale, provides insights into the kinetic behaviors and structural evolution of soft matter systems. 
These simulations have been instrumental in modeling the self-assembly of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipid molecules in food systems, helping researchers predict the formation of various structures and textures in foods.14


### Colloidal systems in foods. 

Colloidal systems represent a fundamental category of so matter characterized by dispersions where one phase is distributed within another at length scales typically ranging from nanometers to micrometers.

At high packing fractions, the system displays compressed exponentialdecay of the intermediate scattering functions and super-diffusive behaviour of themean-squared displacements.

In recent years, colloidal particles have emerged as useful models that give access to phases and states with no counterpart in atomic and molecular systems [1–3].

A crucial parameter controlling colloidal behaviour is particle softness, which can be quantified by the ratio between elastic and thermal energy [10].

Several experimental works [9, 11–13] reported that softness controls the dependence of the structural relaxation time τα on temperature T or on packing fraction ζ – the so called fragility[14].

Landau, L. D. & Lifshitz, E. Theory of elasticity, vol. 7. Course of Theoretical Physics 3, 109 (1986).

To gain microscopic knowledge on this matter (a frigile system), we usually resort on simulations of simple repulsive models, as for example systems interacting with the Hertzian potential [18], which is found to describe microgel particles behavior at moderate packing fractions [19, 20], but is expected to fail in denser conditions where soft colloids tend to shrink, deform or even interpenetrate [21].


Early works have indicated that, for such simple pair potentials, the change of dynamic properties with softness, such as the change of fragility, is modest [22] or absent [23]. 
In these approaches, softness is tuned by modifying a given parameter, e.g. the strength of the repulsion, allowing particles to overlap to a certain extent, but without taking into account their deformability as well as other important aspects in realistic soft particles, namely deswelling [24–27], interpenetration [21] and faceting [28]. 
Thus, there is a strong need to go one step forward in the modeling of soft colloids to tackle this problem and to provide a microscopic picture of these systems at high densities.

Identifying the morphology of the hydrogel backbone enables a bottom-up approach towards the structural and rheological properties of microgel systems. On a local level we use a Flory--Rehner inspired model that focuses on highly swollen networks, characterized by a Poisson's ratio of 1/4. Our ab initio calculations take account for the nonuniform distribution of crosslinker species during the synthesis of poly(N-isopropylacylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels, yet the method is also applicable to other microgel architectures. We recover a single-particle density profile that is in close agreement with SAXS data. Comparison with experimental data confirms that the surface of the cross-linked particle is decorated with dangling polymers ends of considerable size.},

Microgels are sub-micron sized particles with a backbone of crosslinked polymer.
They offer high control (in situ) over shape, size, charge,1,2 and soft interactions3,4 by stimuli such as temperature, pH,5,6 or salt concentration.7

Poly(Nisopropylacylamide) (PNIPAM) polymers exhibit a temperature induced volume phase transition from coil9 to globule around 33 degrees Celsius10 and can be shaped into microgels via precipitation polymerization.11 
This yields particles that reversibly change from a nearly-incompressible sphere to a swollen network upon varying the temperature, which can be used to explore novel routes towards complex structure formation, opens new possibilities for drug delivery12–14 and cell cultivation,15 or can be used to design fluids with adjustable rheological properties.16,17 
The addition of crosslinkers during synthesis is essential for creating stable hydrogel cores and increasing the amount of crosslinkers results in more rigid particles. 
Crosslinkers get predominantly incorporated early during the particle synthesis process due to a different reactivity of the crosslinker species and the NIPAM monomers. 
The resulting particle has, therefore, a relatively dense core and a much softer surface region.18–24 
Dispersing the crosslinker more homogeneously throughout the particle can be promoted by a controlled feed of crosslinker into the reaction mixture.21,25

[So a hydrogel is a type of microgel]

The precise internal structure of the particles and how this quantitatively affects the properties of the suspension is, however, still unclear.


[The importance of crosslinker in the mechanical response]
The celebrated model for describing the swelling of hydrogels is the Flory–Rehner theory,28–30 which has originally been derived to analyze the elastic properties of rubber-like materials.
This model can be used to capture the volume phase transition that is observed for PNIPAM microgels, yet it has been unsuccessful in predicting the elastic moduli and soft interactions between the particles.24
Deviations from bulk-gel behavior due to the crosslinker density gradient may be attributed to this.

It has been suggested by Fernandes et al. that a spatially varying crosslinker distribution can be considered by means of a ‘matryoshka’ approach, i.e. by considering the gel particle as a collection of shells with different gel parameters.31


# Theory and model 

## Homogeneous hydrogels

Swelling of charge-neutral hydrogels is induced by excludedvolume interactions between the segments that constitute the polymer network.

However, an interaction potential unifying their behavior across the entire phase diagram is sorely lacking. Here we investigate microgel suspensions in the fluid regime at different volume fractions and temperatures, and in the presence of another population of small microgels, combining confocal microscopy experiments and numerical simulations. We find that effective interactions between microgels are clearly temperature dependent. In addition, microgel mixtures possess an enhanced stability compared to hard colloid mixtures - a property not predicted by a simple Hertzian model. Based on numerical calculations we propose a multi-Hertzian model, which reproduces the experimental behavior for all studied conditions. Our findings highlight that effective interactions between microgels are much more complex than usually assumed, displaying a crucial dependence on temperature and on~the internal core-corona architecture of the particles.},

Microgels are hybrid particles with dual colloid-polymer nature, belonging to the class of so-called soft  colloids
A microgel consists of a mesoscopic crosslinked polymer network, which can deform, shrink or interpenetrate with another microgel3,4.
Often, as a result of the synthesis conditions, a particle possesses a denser core and a  more loosely crosslinked corona5,6, which also includes so-called  dangling ends7,8.

Microgels are considered smart colloidal materials: in response to external parameters such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, light, or electric field (depending on the nature of the polymers) a particle is able to change its size as well as  other connected properties such as the polarizability9 or elasticity  of the particle10,11.

[Pero a que rangos dimensionales? Cuál es el rango de tamaño del que se refiere?]
Recent research shows that the interactions between swollen microgels can be more accurately reproduced by a soft Hertzian repulsion in  the fluid region of the phase diagram33, while brush-like models  can be used for highly packed samples34,35.



Evidently, it is imperative to consider the variation of the interparticle potential upon changing temperature and, crucially, the internal structure of the microgels to correctly describe their behavior, particularly for conditions where microgels are forced together—for example, in electric field applications or in the dense glassy regime, which is most widely studied in the microgel literature. 
Furthermore, our results raise fundamental questions on the widespread practice to tune the volume fraction via a temperature change without accounting for the different nature of the system.

Despite their widespread use, little is known about how these soft particles adapt their shape and size under strong mechanical compression. We use a combination of precise labeling protocols and two-color superresolution microscopy to unravel the behavior of tracer microgels inside densely packed soft solids.

Microgels are among the most studied colloidal and polymeric systems of the past two decades (1–4). 

In particular, microgels made from thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and its derivatives are of interest (5).
By decorating and functionalizing microgels with nanoparticles, one can add additional optical, chemical, or magnetic sensitivity (6–9).

Swelling the microgel by lowering the temperature can drive a colloidal suspension from the liquid to the solid state, conveniently crossing the glass and the jamming transition without the need to prepare samples of varying composition (10–13).

microgels can be highly overpacked, meaning that the effective volume fraction zeff can be much larger than one (10, 17, 18)


To understand the microstructural changes at high packing densities, it is important to be aware of the complex architecture of individual colloidal microgel particles. 
In microgels, the internal cross-link density is not homogeneous, and moreover, microgels have a fuzzy corona with dangling polymer chains (23). 

The brush-like interactions mediated by these dangling ends can have a profound influence on the onset of repulsive interactions when the microgels swell into contact (11). 
The low-density polymer corona may also allow for deformation and even some mutual interpenetration between adjacent microgels (24). 
Thus, the architecture of swollen microgels permits different competing packing mechanisms such as shape deformation, interpenetration, and compression. 

The main goal of our work is to quantify their relative contribution by nanoscale imaging microgels based on dSTORM (direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) superresolution microscopy (19, 25, 26). 
To this end, we fluorescently label a small subset of microgels and record ultrahigh-resolution two-dimensional (2D) optical image sections. 
The combination of precise labeling protocols and superresolution techniques allows us to map out the different contributions from the marginally jammed state to the deeply overpacked regime. 


# Results

## Microgel properties 

Although the microgels investigated in this study are about 1 mm in diameter, the structural transformations we aim to characterize, as a function of packing density, occur on a significantly smaller length scale.

We demonstrate that the microgels used in this study significantly interpenetrate and thus change their size and shape only marginally even for {$\phi$}eff\,{$\gg$}\,{$\phi$}cp, a finding that may require changes in the interpretation of a number of previously published studies on the structural and dynamic properties of dense soft particle systems.},

Microgel particles are intriguing soft and responsive colloids formed by a cross-linked polymeric structure that can undergo reversible continuous or discontinuous volume transitions upon variations of external stimuli such  as temperature, pH or ionic strength1–3.

In particular thermoresponsive particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)-based microgels have been used recently as seemingly ideal model systems to investigate various  “hot” topics in the physics of crystallisation and melting, dynamical arrest, glass transition and jamming4–8.

These microgel-based investigations have often relied on the ability of the particles to vary their size as a function of temperature, and used temperature as a convenient way to tune the particle size and thus the volume fraction.

Given the fact that microgels can in principle adapt both their size as well as their shape in response to the environment, any attempt to understand the structural and dynamic properties of dense microgel dispersions thus requires quantitative information about the behaviour of the individual particle as a function of temperature and density.

Despite the large number of publications dealing with dense soft particle suspensions, glasses and gels, there is indeed a surprising lack of information about the evolution of the size and shape of soft microgels with increasing concentration at and above close packing.
