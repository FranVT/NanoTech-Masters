The first is based on the virial theorem of Clausius and gives the pressure at the boundary of the system. The second is based on the notion of stress, which is the sum of the appropriate components of the interatomic forces intercepted by an area, and of the components of momentum flux across the area, averaged over the area and over time. We show by means of a detailed comparison of the forces involved that the two methods are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit. In a small system with arbitrary boundary conditions, the neglect of a part of the interactions between the system and the wall results in some error in the pressure calculated by the virial method. In the special case of a system with periodic boundaries, there is no external ’’wall,’’ and the internal pressures calculated by the two methods are the same. However, with comparable effort in computation, the stress method makes more efficient use of the data and yields a result of greater precision than does the virial method. In a system not in equilibrium or not homogeneous, the stress method remains valid but the virial method leads to ambiguous results. These considerations indicate that the method of stress calculation is more general than the virial method.}, number={3}, journal={The Journal of Chemical Physics}, author={Tsai, D.

All three forms are written in terms of forces acting on atoms, and so are valid for arbitrary many-body interatomic potentials. All three forms are mathematically equivalent. In the special case of atoms interacting with pair potentials, they reduce to previously published forms. (i) The atom-cell form is similar to the standard expression for the virial for a finite nonperiodic system, but with an explicit correction for interactions with periodic images. (ii) The atom form is particularly suited to implementation in modern molecular dynamics simulation codes using spatial decomposition parallel algorithms.

abstract = {Microgels are colloidal-scale particles individually made of cross-linked polymer networks that can swell and deswell in response to external stimuli, such as changes to temperature or pH. Despite a large amount of experimental activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles in silico. We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent (cross-linkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our assembly protocol, we focus on a small microgel test case and show that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated assembly methodologies, e.g., in the case of networks generated from an underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely used fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modeling of microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.},

Here, we self-assemble polymer networks via simulations of a mixture of bivalent and tri- or tetravalent patchy particles, which result in an exponential strand length distribution analogous to that of experimental randomly cross-linked systems. After assembly, the network connectivity and topology are frozen and the resulting system is characterized. We find that the fractal structure of the network depends on the number density at which the assembly has been carried out, but that systems with the same mean valence and same assembly density have the same structural properties. Moreover, we compute the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement, also known as the (squared) localization length, of the cross-links and of the middle monomers of the strands, showing that the dynamics of long strands is well described by the tube model. Finally, we find a relation connecting these two localization lengths at high density and connect the cross-link localization length to the shear modulus of the system.},

	abstract = {Due to their unique structural and mechanical properties, randomly cross-linked polymer networks play an important role in many different fields, ranging from cellular biology to industrial processes. In order to elucidate how these properties are controlled by the physical details of the network (e.g., chain-length and end-to-end distributions), we generate disordered phantom networks with different cross-linker concentrations C and initial densities {$\rho$}init and evaluate their elastic properties. We find that the shear modulus computed at the same strand concentration for networks with the same C, which determines the number of chains and the chain-length distribution, depends strongly on the preparation protocol of the network, here controlled by {$\rho$}init. We rationalize this dependence by employing a generic stress-strain relation for polymer networks that does not rely on the specific form of the polymer end-to-end distance distribution. We find that the shear modulus of the networks is a nonmonotonic function of the density of elastically active strands, and that this behavior has a purely entropic origin. Our results show that if short chains are abundant, as it is always the case for randomly cross-linked polymer networks, the knowledge of the exact chain conformation distribution is essential for correctly predicting the elastic properties. Finally, we apply our theoretical approach to literature experimental data, qualitatively confirming our interpretations.},

  abstract = {The microscopic definition for the Cauchy stress tensor has been examined in the past from many different perspectives. This has led to different expressions for the stress tensor and consequently the ``correct'' definition has been a subject of debate and controversy. In this work, a unified framework is set up in which all existing definitions can be derived, thus establishing the connections between them. The framework is based on the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics procedure introduced by Irving, Kirkwood and Noll, followed by spatial averaging. The Irving--Kirkwood--Noll procedure is extended to multi-body potentials with continuously differentiable extensions and generalized to non-straight bonds, which may be important for particles with internal structure. Connections between this approach and the direct spatial averaging approach of Murdoch and Hardy are discussed and the Murdoch--Hardy procedure is systematized. Possible sources of non-uniqueness of the stress tensor, resulting separately from both procedures, are identified and addressed. Numerical experiments using molecular dynamics and lattice statics are conducted to examine the behavior of the resulting stress definitions including their convergence with the spatial averaging domain size and their symmetry properties.},

Here I propose a simple trick for performing molecular dynamics simulations of bond-swapping network systems with particle-level description.
