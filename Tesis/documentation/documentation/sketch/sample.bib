The first is based on the virial theorem of Clausius and gives the pressure at the boundary of the system. The second is based on the notion of stress, which is the sum of the appropriate components of the interatomic forces intercepted by an area, and of the components of momentum flux across the area, averaged over the area and over time. We show by means of a detailed comparison of the forces involved that the two methods are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit. In a small system with arbitrary boundary conditions, the neglect of a part of the interactions between the system and the wall results in some error in the pressure calculated by the virial method. In the special case of a system with periodic boundaries, there is no external ’’wall,’’ and the internal pressures calculated by the two methods are the same. However, with comparable effort in computation, the stress method makes more efficient use of the data and yields a result of greater precision than does the virial method. In a system not in equilibrium or not homogeneous, the stress method remains valid but the virial method leads to ambiguous results. These considerations indicate that the method of stress calculation is more general than the virial method.}, number={3}, journal={The Journal of Chemical Physics}, author={Tsai, D.

All three forms are written in terms of forces acting on atoms, and so are valid for arbitrary many-body interatomic potentials. All three forms are mathematically equivalent. In the special case of atoms interacting with pair potentials, they reduce to previously published forms. (i) The atom-cell form is similar to the standard expression for the virial for a finite nonperiodic system, but with an explicit correction for interactions with periodic images. (ii) The atom form is particularly suited to implementation in modern molecular dynamics simulation codes using spatial decomposition parallel algorithms. (iii) The group form of the virial allows the contributions to the virial to be assigned to individual atoms.}, number={15}, journal={The Journal of Chemical Physics}, author={Thompson, Aidan P. and Plimpton, Steven J. and Mattson, William}, year={2009}, month=oct, pages={154107}, language={en} }

  abstract = {The microscopic definition for the Cauchy stress tensor has been examined in the past from many different perspectives. This has led to different expressions for the stress tensor and consequently the ``correct'' definition has been a subject of debate and controversy. In this work, a unified framework is set up in which all existing definitions can be derived, thus establishing the connections between them. The framework is based on the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics procedure introduced by Irving, Kirkwood and Noll, followed by spatial averaging. The Irving--Kirkwood--Noll procedure is extended to multi-body potentials with continuously differentiable extensions and generalized to non-straight bonds, which may be important for particles with internal structure. Connections between this approach and the direct spatial averaging approach of Murdoch and Hardy are discussed and the Murdoch--Hardy procedure is systematized. Possible sources of non-uniqueness of the stress tensor, resulting separately from both procedures, are identified and addressed. Numerical experiments using molecular dynamics and lattice statics are conducted to examine the behavior of the resulting stress definitions including their convergence with the spatial averaging domain size and their symmetry properties.},
