# New protocol for simulations.

This simulation protocol consists of:
- Heat process (From T=0 to T=0.05)
- Isothermal process (Allow the patchy particle to form a network and reach a minimum of energy)
- A long deformation (20 cycles)
- A relaxation period (To define)
- A short deformation (6 cycles)

It also save the final structure before the long deformation for future deformation processes and analysis.
